AIP Singapore

Amendment service to the AIP (AIP AMDT)
AIP AMDT is published in accordance with the established regular intervals (see GEN 0.1-2 paragraph 3.2). It
incorporates permanent changes to the AIP on the indicated publication date.
A brief description of the amendments and changes made are provided in the AIP AMDT cover page.
Each AIP AMDT cover page also includes references to the serial numbers of those elements, if any, of the
Integrated Aeronautical Information Package which have been incorporated into the AIP by the amendment.
Each AIP AMDT is allocated a serial number which is consecutive and based on the calendar year. The year,
indicated by two digits, is a part of the serial number of the AIP AMDT.

3.4

AIP Supplement (AIP SUP)
Temporary changes of long duration (3 months or more) and information of short duration which contains
extensive text and/or graphics, supplementing the permanent information contained in the AIP, are published
as AIP SUP. Operationally significant changes to the AIP are published in accordance with the AIRAC system
and its established effective dates, and are identified clearly by the acronym AIRAC.
Each AIP SUP (regular or AIRAC) is allocated a serial number which is consecutive and based on the calendar
year.
An AIP SUP is kept as long as all or some of its contents remain valid. The period of validity of the information
contained in the AIP SUP will normally be given in the AIP SUP itself. Alternatively, NOTAM may be used to
indicate changes to the period of validity or cancellation of the AIP SUP.
The checklist of current AIP SUP is published in the monthly plain-language NOTAM List.

3.5

NOTAM and Pre-flight Information Bulletins (PIB)
A NOTAM contains information concerning the establishment, condition or change in any aeronautical facility,
service, procedure or hazard, the timely knowledge of which is essential to personnel engaged in flight operations.
Each NOTAM contains information in the order shown in the ICAO NOTAM format and is composed of
abbreviated phraseology assigned to the ICAO NOTAM code complemented by ICAO abbreviations, indicators,
identifiers, designators, callsigns, frequencies, figures and plain language. NOTAM originated and issued for
Singapore FIR are distributed in ‘A’ series.
NOTAM are published as and when necessary to disseminate information of direct operational significance
which:
a.
b.
c.

is of an ephemeral nature;
requires advance distribution; or
is appropriate to the AIP but needs immediate dissemination.

Each NOTAM is assigned a 4-digit serial number preceded by the letter ‘A’ indicating the series, followed by a
stroke and 2 digits indicating the year of issue. The serial numbers begin with 0001 every year. A checklist of
current NOTAMs is issued every month via the AFS. Additionally, a monthly plain language list of valid NOTAM,

ENR 1 GENERAL RULES AND PROCEDURES
ENR 1.1 GENERAL RULES
1

INTRODUCTION

1.1

Aircraft in flight or operating on the manoeuvring area of an aerodrome shall comply with the general flight rules
applicable to the operation of aircraft (Annex 2). Additionally, aircraft in flight shall comply with the instrument
flight rules (IFR) or the visual flight rules (VFR). An aircraft operating between the hours of sunset and sunrise,
irrespective of weather conditions shall comply with IFR requirements or, if in a control zone during these hours,
shall require special authorisation from ATC. Aircraft operating in controlled airspace shall comply with any
instruction, clearance or request issued by ATC, or shall immediately advise ATC if unable to comply. Aircraft
operating on ATS routes are to maintain track centreline.

2

FLIGHTS ON AIRWAYS (AREA CONTROL)

2.1

INTRODUCTION

2.1.1

Areas of responsibility for the control of flights on airways and the units providing this service are shown in
subsection ENR 2.1.

2.1.2

Separation is based on:
a.
b.
c.

Estimated and actual times over position reporting points;
Reports of visual sighting; and
Radar identification.

Note: As position reports are most commonly used it is important for estimates to be revised and notified to the
ACC if more than 2 minutes in error.
2.1.3

To preserve standard vertical separation from aircraft operating above and below controlled airspace in the
Singapore/Johor Airspace Complex, aircraft shall not be flown within 500ft of the upper and lower limits. Similarly,
an encroachment on the horizontal limits of these airspaces should be avoided because of the proximity of
restricted and danger areas.

2.2

COMMUNICATIONS AND RADIO NAVIGATION REQUIREMENTS

2.2.1

All aircraft operating under IFR or VFR within controlled airspaces shall be equipped with appropriate
communications and navigation equipment enabling them:
a.
b.

To maintain two-way communication with the appropriate ATC unit. The minimum requirement is VHF
RTF equipment suitable for communicating on ATC frequencies and HF RTF beyond the range of VHF.
To maintain track within the lateral limits of the airway and to navigate in accordance with ATC instructions.
The minimum requirement is one radio compass.

2.2.2

The pilot-in-command shall maintain a continuous listening watch on the appropriate air/ground frequency.

2.3

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL CLEARANCE

2.3.1

An air traffic control clearance is an authorisation by ATC for an aircraft to proceed under specified traffic
conditions within controlled airspaces. If for any reason an air traffic control clearance is not acceptable to the
pilot-in-command, he may request an alternative clearance.

2.3.2

The pilot-in-command shall obtain an air traffic control clearance prior to operating in a controlled airspace.

AIP AMDT 03/2019

ENR 1.1-2
12 NOV 2015

2.3.3

AIP Singapore

An air traffic control clearance will contain the following items:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
g.

Aircraft identification;
Clearance limit and route instruction;
Level assignment;
Departure instruction when necessary;
Approach instruction when necessary;
Clearance expiry time when necessary; and
Any special instructions and information.

2.3.4

Request for Amended Clearance. If the amended clearance is requested at a time a position report is made,
the information contained in that report shall be given on the assumption that the aircraft is proceeding in
accordance with the current clearance, and not with that which is being requested.

2.3.5

The contents of an air traffic control clearance or any revisions thereto shall apply only to those portions of the
flight conducted within controlled airspaces.

2.3.6

An air traffic control clearance may be issued direct to an aircraft by an ACC or through an aerodrome control
unit or an air/ground HF RTF communications unit.

2.3.7

Phrases used in air traffic clearances will have the following meanings:
a.

“Clearance expires at ......... (time)”.
If the aircraft is not airborne by the time stated, a fresh clearance shall be obtained.

b.

“Depart not before .......... (time)”.
An aircraft will not be cleared for departure until the time specified.

c.

“Unable to approve .......... (flight planned level)’.
When ATC is unable to approve the flight planned level, an alternative level will be offered whenever
possible, to avoid or reduce delay.

2.3.8

A pilot-in-command operating under VFR in controlled airspaces shall not enter instrument meteorological
conditions without first obtaining an ATC clearance in accordance with the procedure laid down for flights joining
airways. Until such clearance is received, the aircraft must remain in VMC.

2.3.9

Where a flight plan specifies IFR for the first portion of a flight and VFR for the latter portion, the aircraft will
normally be cleared to the point where IFR terminates. (Clearance is not necessary beyond that point unless
within the Singapore-Johor Airspace Complex and CTR).

2.3.10

If an ATC clearance stipulates VFR climb or descent and it becomes evident to the pilot-in-command that VMC
cannot be maintained, he shall hold in VMC and request an alternative clearance.

2.3.11

The pilot-in-command having acknowledged an air traffic control clearance shall not deviate from the provisions
of the clearance unless an amended clearance has been obtained.

2.3.12

Subsection ENR 1.6 provides guidance to pilot-in-command compelled to deviate from the provisions of an air
traffic control clearance because of communications failure.

2.3.13

A flight shall normally be cleared to the aerodrome of first intended landing and the point of leaving controlled
airspace or, in the case of a flight where prior co-ordination with an adjacent unit cannot be established, the FIR
boundary. This is known as the clearance limit.

2.3.14

An aircraft which has been cleared to an intermediate point en-route to await further ATC clearance will whenever
possible, be issued the required ATC clearance at least 5 minutes before the aircraft arrives at the clearance
limit, unless the pilot is instructed to hold over the intermediate holding point until a specified time.

AIP Singapore

ENR 1.1-3
12 NOV 2015

2.3.15

In the event of an aircraft arriving at the clearance limit without having received a further clearance, the
pilot-in-command shall immediately request a further clearance and hold in accordance with the specified holding
pattern where one is established or otherwise the standard holding pattern, maintaining the last assigned cruising
level until further clearance is received. Where no direct ATC coordination facilities between Regional Area
Control Centres exist, pilots on such routes must endeavour, when airborne, to contact the Area Control Centre
of the next FIR which the aircraft is entering and obtain clearance to enter its Control Area before reaching the
transfer point of the two ACCs.

2.3.16

When a flight operates successively in a Control Area and subsequently along the advisory route or area, the
clearance issued for the flight or any revisions thereto will only apply to those portions of the flight conducted
within controlled airspaces.

2.4

ROUTE AND LEVEL ASSIGNMENT

2.4.1

The pilot-in-command shall fly in strict accordance to the route specified by ATC. Deviation from the specified
route may be permitted by ATC if traffic conditions permit.

2.4.2

Traffic permitting ATC will assign the flight planned level if in accordance with the table of Semi-Circular System
of Cruising Levels. Cruising levels below the minimum specified in subsection ENR 3.1 will not be assigned.

2.5

ESSENTIAL TRAFFIC INFORMATION

2.5.1

Essential traffic is that controlled traffic to which the provision of separation by ATC is applicable but, which in
relation to a particular controlled traffic, does not have the required minimum separation.

2.5.2

Essential traffic information shall be issued to controlled flights concerned whenever they constitute essential
traffic to each other.
Note: This information will inevitably relate to controlled flights which are cleared subject to maintaining own
separation and remaining in visual meteorological conditions.

2.5.3

Essential traffic information shall include:
a.
b.
c.

Direction of flight of aircraft concerned;
Type of aircraft concerned;
Level(s) of aircraft concerned and estimated time of passing or if this is not available, the estimated time
of arrival for the reporting point nearest to where the level will be crossed.

2.6

INSTRUCTIONS TO DEPARTING AIRCRAFT

2.6.1

ATC may specify any or all of the following items when issuing clearance to departing aircraft:

2.6.2

a.

Turn after take-off;

b.

Track to make good before turning on desired route;

c.

Initial level to maintain;

d.

Time, point and/or rate at which level change shall be made.

VFR Flights Crossing Airways

2.10.1

VFR flights intending to cross Airways outside the Singapore/Johor Airspace Complex shall only cross them at
various levels plus 500ft at an angle of 90° to the direction of the Airway, or as close as possible to this angle.
Condition for operation of VFR flights are given in page ENR 1.2 para 2.

2.10.2

In an emergency, where neither a radar nor a procedural crossing can be obtained, an Airway may be crossed
at various levels plus 500ft. The various levels referred to are flight levels of whole thousands in feet.

2.11

TEMPORARY DANGER AREAS ON AIRWAYS

2.11.1

Military operations, both air and ground, frequently take place within the Singapore FIR. Danger Areas will be
promulgated by NOTAM, giving the reference point, vertical extent, radius and duration of the operation.

2.11.2

Where danger areas infringe controlled airspace, the areas will not be available for use by civil aircraft at the
levels affected.

2.12

SINGAPORE/JOHOR AIRSPACE COMPLEX - SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

2.12.1

All flights, IFR and VFR, conducted within the Singapore/Johor Airspace Complex are subject to an Air Traffic
Control Clearance and are regulated in accordance with IFR separation standards.

2.12.2

Singapore ACC performs both Area and Approach Control functions for all aircraft landing at Singapore Changi
and Seletar Airports. Procedural traffic bound for RSAF Paya Lebar, Tengah or Sembawang are likewise
controlled by Singapore ACC but such traffic will normally be released to the respective military
aerodrome/approach unit according to traffic circumstances and at the most convenient point within the
Singapore/Johor Airspace Complex. Due to the close proximity of these aerodromes, all FIR procedural traffic
are processed in order of priority irrespective of destination and slight delays may be expected. The
pilot-in-command will call the appropriate Tower at the time, level or place specified by Singapore ACC.

2.12.3

Control instructions for arriving and departing aircraft will be issued in accordance with paras 2.6 and 2.7.

2.13

IFR FLIGHTS OUTSIDE SINGAPORE/JOHOR AIRSPACE COMPLEX IN VMC

2.13.1

The pilot-in-command of an aircraft operating under IFR within 183km (100nm) from Singapore Changi Airport
below FL150 may request a VFR clearance for any portion of the flight. In the absence of such a request, ATC
will issue a full IFR clearance regardless of weather conditions.

2.13.2

Outside the Singapore/Johor Airspace Complex within 100nm from Singapore Changi Airport, when necessary
to expedite traffic, ATC may request a pilot-in-command under IFR below FL150 to conduct portion of the flight
under VFR. An alternative clearance will be issued if the pilot-in-command has any doubt as to his ability to
maintain VFR.

AERODROME/APPROACH CONTROL SERVICE

5.1

INTRODUCTION

5.1.1

Aerodrome/Approach Control issue air traffic control clearances, instructions and information to aircraft to ensure
the safe, orderly and expeditious flow of air traffic.

5.1.2

In VMC all aircraft flying in a control zone (CTR) or aerodrome traffic zone (ATZ) come under Aerodrome Control.
This does not, however, relieve the pilot-in-command from responsibility for avoiding collision.

5.1.3

In VMC control of traffic on the runway in use and in the air is shared between Aerodrome Control and Approach
Control. Normally, departing aircraft is the responsibility of Approach Control when airborne, whilst arriving
aircraft is handed over to Aerodrome Control after it has been properly sequenced for an approach to land. The
actual point of transfer depends on traffic conditions and is coordinated between the two units. Control of traffic
on other parts of the manoeuvring area, with the exception of the marshalling area, is the responsibility of
Aerodrome Control.

5.1.4

CTR dimensions and controlling authorities are specified in section ENR 3.

5.2

PROCEDURE

5.2.1

Holding, instrument approach, arrival and departure procedures are specified in subsections ENR 1.5 and ENR
3.6.

5.2.2

Radio communication shall be established with the appropriate Aerodrome/Approach Control Unit:
a.
b.

Prior to taxiing for departure; or
When intending to operate in a CTR, CTA or ATZ.

5.2.3

For IFR or VFR operation in a CTR, aircraft shall be equipped with appropriate two-way VHF radio apparatus,
plus a radio compass. Exemptions may be granted by the appropriate Controlling Authority.

5.2.4

A pilot-in-command under IFR or VFR intending to enter, cross or operate within a CTR or ATZ shall request a
clearance from the Aerodrome/Approach Control on the appropriate radio frequency. He shall:
a.
b.
c.
d.

Pass the aircraft’s position, level, track and estimated time of crossing the zone boundary;
Maintain a continuous listening watch on that frequency while the aircraft is within the zone;
Navigate in accordance with the flight plan and ATC clearance;
Carry out any instructions received from Aerodrome/Approach Control.

5.2.5

All flights within a CTR, at night or in IMC, shall be conducted in accordance with IFR or special authorisation
by ATC. However, in order to expedite traffic, ATC may clear an aircraft for a visual approach if weather conditions
permit.

5.2.6

Special VFR Flight

5.2.6.1

A Special VFR flight is a VFR flight cleared by air traffic control to operate within a control zone in meteorological
conditions below VMC.

5.2.6.2

Special VFR flights may be authorised to enter a control zone for the purpose of landing or to take-off and depart
directly from a control zone when the ground visibility is not less than 1.5km (1 mile). The pilot of an aircraft on
a Special VFR flight:
a.
b.
c.

5.2.6.3

Must comply with ATC instructions;
Is responsible for ensuring that his flight conditions enable him to remain clear of cloud, determine his
flight path with reference to the surface and keep clear of obstructions;
Is responsible for ensuring that he flies within the limitations of his licence. Controllers are not responsible
for checking pilot’s qualifications.

A Special VFR clearance shall be issued only when specifically requested by a pilot.

ENR 1.1-8
12 NOV 2015

5.2.6.4

AIP Singapore

Before clearing a Special VFR flight a controller must consider the prevailing traffic conditions, the extent of the
proposed flight and the availability of air/ground communications. IFR flights take precedence over Special VFR
flights. Standard separation shall be provided:
a.
b.

Between IFR flights and Special VFR flights;
Between flights operating on Special VFR clearance except where a reduction is specifically authorised
by CAAS.

5.2.6.5

Aircraft on Special VFR clearance are not normally given a specific height to fly but for the purpose of ensuring
vertical separation from other aircraft flying above, the Special VFR flight may be required to fly not above a
specified level.

5.3

SEPARATION STANDARDS

5.3.1

All flights VFR or IFR within CTRs will be regulated in accordance with IFR separation standards unless the
conditions stated in page ENR 1.7-8 para 4.10.2 prevail. ATC Services are also provided to aircraft within ATZs.

5.4

SPECIAL SEPARATION STANDARD - WAKE TURBULENCE

5.4.1

The relevant wake separation minima contained in ICAO PANS-ATM DOC 4444 are applied by ATC.

5.5

VISUAL CIRCUIT REPORTING PROCEDURE

5.5.1

a.

Downwind
Aircraft shall report “Downwind” abeam the upwind end of the runway.

b.

Base Leg
Aircraft shall report “Base Leg” on completion of the turn on to base leg.

c.

Final
Aircraft shall report “Final” after completion of the turn on to final approach, not more than 4NM from the
approach end of the runway.

d.

Long Final
Aircraft flying a straight-in approach shall report “Long Final” 8NM from the approach end of the runway,
and “Final” when at 4NM.

Note: At grass aerodrome, the area to be used for landing is regarded as the runway for the purposes of
reporting position in the circuit.

5.6

USE OF RUNWAY

5.6.1

The Aerodrome Controller will nominate the runway direction according to prevailing conditions.

5.6.2

Notwithstanding the runway direction nominated by ATC, the pilot-in-command shall ensure that there is sufficient
length of run and that the crosswind or downwind component is within the operational limits of each particular
operation. If the nominated runway direction is not suitable for these reasons or for any other safety reason, he
may request for an alternative runway direction. ATC will grant the use of an alternative runway direction but
the flight may be subject to some delay because of other traffic.

5.6.3

The decision to undertake a take-off or landing rests solely with the pilot-in-command.

5.6.4

Unless prior permission has been obtained from ATC, the pilot-in-command shall not hold on the runway in use.

5.6.5

Only one aircraft will be cleared to land on the runway in use at any one time.

5.6.6

In VMC, an aircraft may be cleared to continue approach to a runway occupied by a preceding aircraft but
clearance to land will not be given until the runway is vacated.

5.7

CLOSURE OF AERODROMES

5.7.1

Aircraft will not be refused permission to land or take off from airfields in the Singapore FIR solely because of
adverse weather conditions. The pilot-in-command of a public transport aircraft shall be responsible for operation
in accordance with applicable company weather minima.

5.7.2

Aerodrome will be closed:
a.
b.

When the surface of the landing area is unfit (e.g. soft surface or dangerous obstruction on the manoeuvring
area); or
At such other times and in conditions specified by NOTAM.

5.7.3

In an emergency, an aircraft will be permitted to land regardless of the conditions of the aerodrome and aerodrome
facilities, but the pilot will be advised of these conditions.

5.8

REGULATING OF AIR TRAFFIC MOVEMENTS AFTER CLOSURE OF SINGAPORE
CHANGI AIRPORT'S RUNWAY/CONTROL ZONE

5.8.1

In order to prevent unnecessary air traffic congestion which normally occurs following the resumption of air traffic
operations after the closure of the Singapore Changi Airport’s Runways/Control Zone, due to VIP Movement or
Major Air Exercise, slot-times will be introduced to regulate the flow of aircraft which are scheduled to depart
for a period of at least one hour after the commencement of operations. Thus, depending on the prevailing traffic
conditions all such departures will be spaced at intervals of 5 minutes or more to minimise unnecessary delays
on the ground, which may be caused by arriving aircraft.

5.8.2

During the one hour period, pilots will be required to give ATC 5 minutes notice prior to starting engines.

5.8.3

Slot time is defined as the time during which take-off clearance may be expected.

5.9

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL CLEARANCES

5.9.1

All flights within a CTR, or ATZ, irrespective of weather conditions, require an air traffic control clearance.

5.9.2

The pilot-in-command of an aircraft departing from a CTR or an ATZ shall obtain an air traffic control clearance
prior to departure.

5.9.3

A clearance to enter or cross a CTR or ATZ will include the following information:
a.
b.
c.

A clearance limit and holding instructions, if necessary;
The route to be flown; and
The altitude or flight level.

NOISE ABATEMENT PROCEDURE

5.10.1

To alleviate the problem of noise, all aircraft on Awy G579 between SINJON and JAYBEE shall operate at/above
5,000ft.

5.11

SPEED CONTROL PROCEDURES FOR ARRIVALS INTO AIRPORTS IN SINGAPORE

5.11.1

Speed control procedures are in force unless notified otherwise by ATC or on ATIS.

5.11.2

All arriving turbo-propeller and turbo-jet aircraft are to fly at not faster than indicated air speed 250knots when
within 40NM from Singapore Changi Airport or when at or below 10,000ft, except all arriving aircraft into Singapore
Changi Airport shall comply with the speed restrictions depicted on the transitions and RNAV STARs. Further
speed reductions will be regulated by ATC as necessary.

5.11.3

All arrivals into Singapore Changi Airport will be issued instructions by ATC to maintain 180KT till 8NM from
touchdown and thereafter 150kt till 4NM from touchdown.

5.11.4

Pilots who may not be able to comply with the speed limits specified above for reasons of flight safety and/or
weather should inform ATC and state the speed(s) acceptable.

5.12

AUTHORIZATION

5.12.1

Either an IFR clearance or a Special VFR authorisation shall be issued by Air Traffic Control prior to every
movement within a control zone in the following weather conditions:
When the ceiling is less than 1,500ft and/or a visibility less than 5km.

5.12.2

The deciding factors determining whether conditions are such that compliance with IFR or Special VFR
authorisation is required will be the official meteorological observations.

5.12.3

When a pilot so requests and traffic conditions permit, Special VFR flight may be authorised within control zones,
clear of cloud and in sight of land or water.

5.12.4

When a Special VFR flight has been authorised, ATC will provide it with standard separation from other similar
flights and any IFR flight.

5.12.5

Special VFR flights will not normally be given a special level to fly; they will be merely instructed to remain clear
of cloud and in sight of land or water. If, however, it is necessary to provide vertical separation from aircraft
above, the Special VFR flight will be instructed not to fly above a certain level.

5.12.6

A Special VFR flight may be required to make good a prescribed track. When no track is prescribed, the pilot
must fly directly towards his destination or towards the first turning point shown in the flight plan.

5.12.7

Special VFR absolves the pilot from complying with Instrument Flight Rules. Special VFR flight does not, however,
absolve the pilot-in-command from the responsibility of maintaining minimum safe levels as prescribed in Part
2, para 5 of the eleventh Schedule of the Air Navigation Order. He must comply with ATC instructions and it will
be entirely his responsibility to ensure that his flight conditions i.e. forward visibility and distance from cloud, will
enable him to determine his flight path and remain clear of all obstructions.

5.12.8

Authorisation for Special VFR flight will depend not only upon zonal traffic conditions but also whether or not
air/ground communications can be maintained and the extent of the flight proposed.

5.13

APPLICATION OF GENERAL FLIGHT RULES

5.13.1

Aircraft flying under Special VFR authorisation are subject to the general flight rules. Compliance with these
rules is the responsibility of the pilot.

REQUIREMENTS FOR AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY

6.1

Section 7 of the Air Navigation Act provides that no aerial photography of protected places in Singapore may
be undertaken without the written permission of the Director-General of Civil Aviation. Applications for Aerial
Photography Permits must be submitted in duplicate, one copy to the Director-General of Civil Aviation and the

DATA LINK SERVICES IN SINGAPORE FIR

8.1

INTRODUCTION

8.1.1

Data link services are available to FANS 1/A compatible aircraft (which are compliant to RTCA DO- 258A or
ED EUROCAE 100A) on ATS Routes G334, L504, L517, L625, L642, L644, L649, M646, M753, M758, M761,
M767, M768, M771, M772, M904, N875, N884, N891 and N892 in the Singapore FIR daily on a 24-hour basis.

8.1.2

The introduction of data link services does not affect current procedures for non-data link equipped aircraft
operating in the same airspace.

8.2

BACKGROUND

8.2.1

Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) data link
applications will be used to provide services to FANS 1/A equipped aircraft, in particular within the Singapore
FIR beyond the range of existing radar / ADS-B and VHF voice communications. Area Navigation (RNAV) routes
suitable for ADS-C and / or CPDLC logon are described in ENR 3.3.

8.2.2

Messages will be transferred by VHF and satellite data link.

8.2.3

CPDLC supports the following services:
a.

Emergency alerting;

b.

Pilot to Controller downlink of position reports and clearance requests;

c.

Controller to Pilot uplink of ATC clearances and instructions; and

d.

Free text as a supplement to pre-formatted message elements.

8.2.4

Pre-Departure Clearance (PDC) via CPDLC is available on selected ATS routes/destinations as described in
WSSS AD 2.22 paragraph 8.4.

8.2.5

Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) supports automatic reporting by the aircraft Flight Management
System (FMS) of aircraft position and intent information. The FMS reports the required information in accordance
with parameters selected by the ground system.

8.3

LOGON PROCEDURES

8.3.1

The AFN LOGON address for the Singapore FIR is WSJC.

8.3.2

To avoid automatic rejection of the LOGON, the flight identification number used by the pilot in the LOGON
process must be identical to the flight identification number filed in the flight plan.

8.3.3

A LOGON must be received from the aircraft before any data link connections can be initiated by the ground
system. This is achieved via the ATS facility notification (AFN) LOGON process to be initiated by the pilot in
accordance with company procedures.

8.3.4

Aircraft requesting data link services inbound to Singapore FIR are required to manually LOGON onto WSJC
at least 10 minutes prior to the estimated time for entering Singapore FIR. Data link equipped aircraft departing
from aerodromes within the Singapore FIR and requesting data link may LOGON to WSJC prior to departure.
Pilots who are unable to establish a data link connection are to inform ATC on VHF or HF RTF.

8.3.5

Pilots are reminded to provide the flight level on first contact with HF, including when established on data link.

8.4

APPLICATION OF CPDLC

8.4.1

Aircraft operating outside radar coverage and not in the ADS-B exclusive airspace within the Singapore FIR
shall establish contact with ATC using CPDLC as a primary means of communication except for the following:
a.
b.
c.

prior instruction to contact ATC on VHF;
receive notice that CPDLC service is not available; and
during data link outage.

8.4.2

To ensure the correct synchronisation of messages, controller/pilot dialogues opened by CPDLC must be closed
by CPDLC. Controller/pilot dialogues opened by voice must be closed by voice.

8.4.3

Due to inherent integrity checks and a coded reference to any preceding related message contained within
CPDLC messages, a clearance issued by CPDLC requires only the appropriate CPDLC response, not a read-back
as would be required if the clearance had been issued by voice.

8.4.4

The down link response “WILCO” indicates that the pilot accepts the full terms of the whole uplink message.

8.4.5

A down link response “AFFIRM” is not an acceptable acknowledgement or reply to a CLEARANCE issued by
CPDLC.

8.4.6

To avoid ambiguity in message handling and response, a CPDLC downlink message should not contain more
than one clearance request.

8.4.7

If multiple clearance requests are contained in a single downlink message and the controller cannot approve all
requests, the uplink message element “UNABLE” will be sent as a response to the entire message. A separate
message containing a response to those requests that can be complied with will be sent by the controller.

8.4.8

If any ambiguity exists as to the intent of a particular message, clarification must be sought by voice.

8.4.9

Standard pre-formatted message elements must be used whenever possible. Free text messages should be
used only when an appropriate pre-formatted message element does not exist or to supplement the pre-formatted
message element. The use of free text should be kept to a minimum.

8.4.10

When CPDLC connection is established, aircraft will be instructed to transfer from voice to CPDLC.
The phraseology used is:
TRANSFER TO SINGAPORE CONTROL ON DATA LINK [position];
MONITOR [HF frequency primary/secondary]

8.4.11

Pilots should down link a CPDLC position report upon position over first compulsory reporting point when aircraft
enters Singapore FIR. Pilots are also required to make AIREPS at ATS/MET reporting points using CPDLC
regardless of ADS connection.

8.4.12

CPDLC connections will be terminated at the FIR boundary position or when entering radar coverage. The
CONTACT [unit name][frequency] message and the END SERVICE message will be sent as separate messages.
The END SERVICE message will be sent as soon as possible after receipt of the WILCO response to the
CONTACT message.

8.5

APPLICATION OF ADS

8.5.1

ADS Periodic contracts will be established automatically on receipt of a LOGON.

8.5.2

The Periodic reporting rate is 10 minutes for aircraft operating outside radar coverage and 20 minutes for aircraft
operating within radar coverage.

8.5.3

For ADS logged-on aircraft, CPDLC position reports are not required except when the following event occurs:
a.
b.

8.5.4

upon position over first compulsory reporting point when aircraft enters Singapore FIR;
aircraft at ATS/MET reporting point.

ADS contracts will be terminated automatically at a system parameter time after the aircraft has left the Singapore
FIR.

8.6

DATA LINK FAILURE

8.6.1

Pilots recognising a failure of a CPDLC connection must immediately establish communications on the appropriate
voice frequency. When voice communications have been established, voice must continue to be used as the
primary medium until a CPDLC connection has been re-established and the controller has authorised the return
to data link.

8.6.2

In the event of an expected CPDLC shutdown, the controller will immediately advise all data link connected
aircraft of the failure by voice. Instructions will continue to be issued by voice until the return of the data link
system. The return of the system to an operational state will require a new AFN LOGON from the affected
aircraft.

8.7

FLIGHT PLAN NOTIFICATION

8.7.1

Aircraft planning to utilise data link communications must annotate their ICAO flight plan as follows:

WEATHER DEVIATION PROCEDURES FOR USE IN THE SINGAPORE FIR

9.1

GENERAL

9.1.1

Deviations applicable in the South China Sea airspace, particularly outside the coverage of direct controller-pilot
VHF communication.

9.1.2

These procedures are intended to enhance ICAO Regional Supplementary Procedures (DOC 7030). However,
it must be recognised that all possible circumstances cannot be covered. The pilot’s judgement shall ultimately
determine the sequence of actions taken and ATC shall render all possible assistance.

9.1.3

If an aircraft is required to deviate from track to avoid weather and prior clearance cannot be obtained, an ATC
clearance shall be obtained at the earliest possible time. In the meantime, the aircraft shall broadcast its position
(including the ATS route designator or the track code, as appropriate) and intentions on frequency 121.5MHz
at suitable intervals until ATC clearance is received.

9.1.4

The pilot shall advise ATC when weather deviation is no longer required or when a weather deviation has been
completed and the aircraft has returned to its cleared track.

AIP Singapore

ENR 1.1-15
08 NOV 2018

9.2

OBTAINING ATC PRIORITY WHEN WEATHER DEVIATION IS REQUIRED

9.2.1

When the pilot initiates communications with ATC, rapid response may be obtained by stating that “WEATHER
DEVIATION IS REQUIRED” to indicate that priority is desired on the frequency and for ATC response.

9.2.2

The pilot also retains the option of initiating the communication using the urgency call “PAN-PAN” 3 times to
alert all listening parties of a special handling condition which will receive ATC priority for issuance of a clearance
or assistance.

9.3

ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN WHEN PILOT-CONTROLLER COMMUNICATIONS ARE
ESTABLISHED

9.3.1

When two-way pilot-controller communications are in effect, and a pilot identifies the need to deviate from track
to avoid weather, the pilot shall notify ATC and request clearance to deviate from track, advising where possible
the extent of the deviation expected.

9.3.2

ATC will then take one of the following actions:
i.
ii.
iii.

if there is no conflicting traffic in the lateral dimension, ATC shall issue clearance to deviate from track;
if there is conflicting traffic in the lateral dimension, ATC shall separate aircraft by establishing vertical
separation and issue a clearance to deviate from track;
if there is conflicting traffic in the lateral dimension, and ATC is unable to establish vertical separation,
ATC shall advise the pilot and provide information on all other aircraft with which the aircraft could potentially
conflict.

9.3.3

The pilot shall comply with the ATC clearance issued for the deviation or, if ATC is unable to issue a revised
clearance, and after evaluating the circumstances of the situation, the pilot shall execute the procedures detailed
in paragraph 9.4 below. The pilot shall immediately inform ATC of intentions and ATC will issue essential traffic
information to all affected aircraft.

9.3.4

The pilot shall, at regular intervals, update ATC of the extent and progress of the deviation to ensure that
separation applied is not infringed or to enable ATC to update essential traffic information.

9.4

ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN WHEN PILOT-CONTROLLER COMMUNICATIONS ARE NOT
ESTABLISHED OR REVISED ATC CLEARANCE IS NOT AVAILABLE

9.4.1

If contact cannot be established, or a revised ATC clearance is not available and deviation from track is required
to avoid weather, the pilot shall take the following actions:
a.

deviate away from an organised track or route system, if possible;

b.

broadcast aircraft position and intentions on frequency 121.5MHz at suitable intervals stating:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.

flight identification;
flight level;
track code or ATS route designator; and
extent of deviation expected.

c.

watch for conflicting traffic both visually and by reference to TCAS (if equipped);

d.

turn on aircraft exterior lights;

e.

when the aircraft is approximately 10NM from track, initiate a level change based on the following criteria:

Route Centreline
Track
East
000-179 Mag
West
180-359 Mag

Deviation Greater

f.

when returning to track, be established at the assigned flight level or altitude when the aircraft is within
approximately 10NM of track;

g.

if contact cannot be established prior to deviation, continue to attempt to contact ATC to obtain a clearance.
If contact is subsequently established, continue to keep ATC advised of intentions and obtain essential
traffic information.

DEPARTING FLIGHTS

3.1

INTRODUCTION

3.2

a.

The Instrument Departure Procedures are only applicable for aircraft with all engines operating. It remains
the responsibility of the operator to develop contingency procedures for the individual type of aeroplane
and to conduct the necessary examination of obstacles throughout the areas concerned in relation to the
certificated performance of the individual aeroplane type. It is also the responsibility of the operator to
ensure that contingency procedures comply fully with the aeroplane performance requirements of ICAO
Annex 6.

b.

The specific routes to be followed are depicted in SID charts AD-2-WSSS-SID-1 to AD-2-WSSS-SID-18.
Altitude restrictions at fixes and/or DME specify ATC/airspace requirements.

c.

Minimum climb gradient specifies obstacle clearance requirements.

d.

In the event that the minimum climb gradient cannot be achieved pilots shall inform ATC. ATC shall hold
departures if pilots indicate that they are unable to meet the required climb gradient.

RUNWAY 02L
a.

When there are no reports of vessel movement along the northern shipping channel or where the reported
vessel height is less than 32m AMSL, all aircraft departures on Runway 02L, regardless of on SID or
vectors, shall be on a minimum climb gradient of 3.3%.

b.

Where the reported vessel height is 33m or higher, ATC shall advise departing pilots of the vessel height.
Pilots on receipt of this information shall apply the minimum climb gradient in accordance with the following

DETERMINATION OF CLIMB GRADIENT BY OPERATORS

3.5.1

The minimum climb gradients specified above need not apply to operators who wish to calculate their own climb
gradients based on actual lift-off point, provided the calculation ensures the following:

3.5.2

i.

The most penalising obstacle is taken into account under both all engines operating procedures as well
as one engine out procedures; and

ii.

The required minimum obstacle clearance (MOC) is met under all engines operating procedures.

For the above calculations, operators shall use the following information:
a.

The most penalising obstacle is a tall vessel which is on the extended centre line of the runway. (ATC
shall advise pilots of the height of the tall vessel).

b.

The required MOC in 3.5.1 (ii) is 0.8% of the distance d from the departure end of runway (DER) to the
obstacle, in accordance with Vol II of ICAO Doc 8168: Procedures for Air Navigation Services Operations
(PANS-OPS) where, in the case of Singapore Changi Airport, the DER is defined as the end of the
clearway.

c.

The distance d for departure Runways 02L and 02C is measured from the DER to the shipping channel
north of Changi. The distance d for departure Runways 20C and 20R is measured from the DER to the
boundary of the restricted waters south of Changi wherein tall vessels of height above 49m AMSL are not
permitted. The distance d for the various departure runways is as follows:

ENR 1.6 ATC SURVEILLANCE SERVICES AND PROCEDURES
1

PRIMARY RADAR

1.1

DESCRIPTION OF PRIMARY RADAR SERVICES AND PROCEDURES

1.1.1

Radar control service is provided to identified aircraft operating in controlled airspace. The approximate area
within which radar services are provided is shown in Table A on page ENR 1.6-7. Positive traffic separation
service is provided. This involves monitoring the navigation of, or issuing instructions for, the navigation of an
aircraft, to ensure that radar separation standards are maintained between identified aircraft and other aircraft
in controlled airspace.

1.1.2

Radar advisory service is provided to aircraft operating outside controlled airspace. This service may be provided
to identified aircraft subject to radar coverage and workload and involves the provision of position information
to aircraft to assist in its navigation, warnings of other aircraft operating in its proximity and assistance to aircraft
in an emergency. Advice and/or suggestion to pilots will be given. Aircraft receiving radar advisory service are
not obliged to follow instructions given by ATC.

1.1.3

Radar control will be exercised outside controlled airspace only in respect of aircraft which are intending to enter
or cross controlled airspace.

1.1.4

Singapore Radar Units will use the following callsigns when providing radar service:
a.

Aircraft under Area Control (ACC) - Singapore Radar;

b.

Aircraft under Approach Control (ACR)
i.
ii.
iii.

1.1.5

Flow Control;
Singapore Approach;
Singapore Arrival.
(See Table A in page ENR 1.6-7)

The minimum horizontal radar separation are:
a.
b.

7NM beyond 150NM from Singapore Changi Airport;
5NM up to 150NM from Singapore Changi Airport.

1.1.6

Whenever SSR is used without its associated primary radar the separation minimum in a) and b) are increased
to 15NM and 10NM respectively.

1.1.7

Radar separation may be reduced to 3NM provided the following conditions exist:
a.
b.
c.

Aircraft are under the Terminal Approach Control Radar Unit;
Aircraft are below FL245;
Aircraft are within 40NM of Singapore Changi Airport.

1.1.8

It is not possible to specify separation minima between identified aircraft and unknown traffic considered to
constitute a hazard due to unpredictable manoeuvres of the latter. However, whenever practicable, the minimum
radar separation shall be applied.

1.2

AIRCRAFT IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES

1.2.1

Before providing a radar service aircraft will be identified by one of the following methods:
a.

By a pilot report over a prescribed position displayed on the radar map or plotted on the radar map outlay;

b.

By issuing instructions to a pilot to carry out a turn or turns or by observing a turn or turns reported by a
pilot;

c.

By observing and correlating the radar echo of a departing aircraft to a known airborne time;

d.

By the use of SSR.

1.3

RADAR NAVIGATION

1.3.1

Whether or not radar control is being applied, navigation along the authorised flight routes is normally the
responsibility of the pilot-in-command but, for a number of reasons, primarily the separation and expedition of
traffic, the radar controller may require to establish positive control. Pilots will be advised when radar navigation
of the aircraft is terminated whereupon pilots will resume their own navigation.

1.3.2

Position information will be given as follows:
a.

A well-known geographical position;

b.

Bearing and distance (using points of the compass) from a known position;

c.

Magnetic heading (QDM) and distance to the appropriate reporting point or en-route navigational facility;

d.

A distance to the runway touchdown point (as “track miles” to run).

1.4

WEATHER AVOIDANCE AND STORM WARNING RADAR

1.4.1

Modern ATC radar equipment are normally designed to suppress weather clutter and the radar controller may
not always be aware of its presence. If, however, weather is observed the radar controller may pass this
information to the pilot, if it appears likely to affect his flight.

1.4.2

When this service is provided to aircraft within controlled airspace, the pilot will be advised by the radar controller
if the action will result in the aircraft leaving controlled airspace. The pilot will be responsible for deciding whether
to accept a detour into uncontrolled airspace.

1.4.3

If an aircraft is equipped with storm warning radar and the pilot intends to detour a storm centre observed on
his radar display, he should, when operating within controlled airspace, obtain clearance from the radar controller
for his proposed action and, if leaving controlled airspace, request permission to rejoin. This is necessary to
ensure that separation which the radar controller may be providing to other aircraft is not prejudiced. The pilot
may request navigational assistance as necessary.

1.4.4

An aircraft flying in uncontrolled airspace under circumstances arising from paras 1.4.2 or 1.4.3 above will be
provided with the following services.

1.4.5

When ATC initiates the diversion out of controlled airspace, as in para 1.4.2 above, the radar controller will
provide avoiding action from unknown aircraft.

1.4.6

When the pilot initiates the weather detour, as in para 1.4.3 above, only advice on the position of unknown aircraft
and the recommended action would be given e.g. “Unknown aircraft ten o’ clock, eight NM, crossing left to right.
Advise turn right heading 090”.

1.5

MILITARY RADAR UNITS AUTHORISED TO PROVIDE RADAR CROSSING SERVICE

1.5.1

The Military Radar Units authorised to provide radar crossings of controlled areas (airways) by military aircraft
are:
a.

RSAF 201 Squadron (Air Defence Radar Unit-ADRU); and

b.

RSAF 203 Squadron (Singapore Air Traffic Control Centre).

1.6

RADAR FAILURE

1.6.1

In the event of radar failure or loss of radar contact, instructions will be issued by the radar controller to restore
standard longitudinal, lateral or vertical separation between those aircraft operating with radar separation.
Instructions may also be given to aircraft to communicate on another ATC frequency.

1.7

RADIO FAILURE

1.7.1

In the event of failure of two-way communications while operating on the radar frequency, the pilot shall change
to any other alternative ATC frequencies and request instructions.

1.7.2

If able to receive but not transmit, the pilot shall remain on the frequency on which he has been communicating
and comply with instructions issued by the radar controller designed to establish that the aircraft is receiving. If
this is established, further instructions appropriate to the circumstances will be issued.

1.7.3

If unable to make contact on the alternative frequencies, the pilot shall comply with the standard radio failure
procedures as specified below.

1.8

TOTAL RADIO COMMUNICATION FAILURE PROCEDURES

1.8.1

If total radio communication failure occurs in VMC during daylight hours, the pilot shall continue to fly in VMC
and land at the most suitable aerodrome. If it occurs in VMC during the hours of darkness (between sunset and
sunrise) action shall be taken in accordance with para 1.8.2 below.

1.8.2

If total radio communication failure occurs in IMC, ATC action is based on the assumption that the aircraft will
continue to its destination and if unable to land, will proceed to its nominated alternate. Separation standards
will be increased and airspace reserved accordingly. (see Appendices ‘A’ and ‘B’ , pages ENR 1.6-9 and 1.6-11).

1.8.3

In IMC, or if unable to maintain VFR, the pilot shall either leave or avoid controlled airspace and areas of dense
traffic and establish VFR operation or, alternatively, shall:
a.

Proceed according to the current flight plan, at the last assigned flight level, to the clearance limit and
thereafter at the flight plan level.

b.

Arrive at the destination as close as possible to ETA.

c.

Commence descent as close as possible to EAT (or ETA if no EAT has been acknowledged).

d.

If unable to land within 30 minutes of the time descent should have started (i.e. EAT or ETA if no EAT has
been acknowledged), proceed to cross SAMKO Holding Area (SHA) at 4,000ft then via A457 at FL200
if Kuala Lumpur is the nominated alternate or via B470 at FL290 if Soekarno- Hatta is the nominated
alternate or otherwise proceed at the planned flight level to other nominated alternate.
Note:
1) Aircraft are to follow the established radio failure procedures as laid down by the respective airports.
2) During this 30 minute period ATC will reserve the airspace at the aircraft’s flight level and below. At
the expiry of this period with the concurrence of other users normal operations will resume.

1.8.4

In all cases, the pilot shall contact ATC as soon as possible after landing.

1.9

RADIO FAILURE - TRANSPONDER - EQUIPPED AIRCRAFT

1.9.1

Aircraft equipped with transponder shall set transponder to Mode A/C Code 7600.

1.9.2

Partial Radio Failure
a.

Aircraft Unable to Receive
Pilots shall adopt the complete RTF failure procedures specified in para 1.8.

b.

Aircraft Able to Receive
Following verification that aircraft is able to receive ground transmissions, ATC will continue to issue
instructions and/or clearance to pilots. Such instructions and clearances will be repeated.

1.11

IDENTIFICATION OF RUNWAY-IN-USE

1.11.1

ATC will switch on the appropriate approach lights and the ILS serving the runway-in-use to assist the pilot in
its identification. If the approach lights for the runway-in-use are sighted but the ILS frequency is not received,
the pilot shall assume that the ILS is inoperative and shall proceed to land on the runway on which the approach
lights have been sighted.

1.11.2

If unable to land within 30 minutes of EAT or ETA, if no EAT has been received and acknowledged, proceed in
accordance with AIP page ENR 1.6-3 para 1.8.3 (d).

1.12

TOTAL RADIO FAILURE - SPECIAL PROCEDURES - SINGAPORE CHANGI AP DEPARTURES

1.12.1

When an aircraft which has been cleared by ATC to an intermediate level experiences total radio communication
failure immediately after departure from Singapore Changi Airport and it is deemed unsafe for it to continue to
its destination, the pilot will set the aircraft transponder to Mode A/C Code 7600 and adhere to the procedures
below.

1.12.2

When radio communication failure occurs immediately after the aircraft has departed on RWY 02L/ 02C, the
pilot shall proceed according to the following procedures:
1.

Proceed straight ahead to NYLON Holding Area (NHA) climbing to the last assigned altitude. At NHA,
climb/descend to maintain 7,000ft;

2.

1.12.3

After fuel jettison, proceed to SAMKO Holding Area (SHA) via Awy G580 and SINJON DVOR. Maintain
7,000ft. At SHA descend for an instrument approach on RWY 02L/02C. Identify the runway-in-use in
accordance with para 1.11 above.

When radio communication failure occurs immediately after the aircraft has departed on RWY 20R/ 20C, the
pilot shall proceed according to the following procedures:
a.

Proceed straight ahead to SAMKO Holding Area (SHA) climbing to the last assigned altitude. At SHA
climb/descend to maintain 7,000ft;

b.

Hold at SHA for 4 minutes. Leave SHA for HOSBA Holding Area (HHA) via SJ DVOR and Airway G580
to jettison fuel, maintaining 7,000ft;

c.

After fuel jettison, proceed to NHA via Airway W401. Maintain 7,000ft. On crossing VTK 042R turn right
to intercept VTK 023R. At NHA descend to carry out an instrument approach on RWY 20R/20C.

1.12.4

ATC action is based on the assumption that the aircraft will take a minimum of 10 min to jettison fuel. An aircraft
therefore should not leave earlier than 10 min after arrival at HOSBA Holding Area even if fuel jettison is completed
at a shorter time or if jettisoning is not necessary or possible unless circumstances require an immediate return.

1.12.5

Alternatively, aircraft may jettison fuel between HOSBA and point 80NM from VTK DVOR/DME on Airway G580.

1.13

ENR 1.7 ALTIMETER SETTING PROCEDURES
1

INTRODUCTION

1.1

A common transition altitude of 11,000ft (3,350 metres) has been established in the Singapore Flight Information
Region. This will ensure uniformity in the transition altitudes for aerodromes within the territories of Brunei,
Malaysia and Singapore, except for an area of radius 10 nautical miles centred on Mount Kinabalu where the
lowest safe altitude will be 15,000ft (4,570 metres) and the lowest usable flight level will be FL170.

1.2

The maximum variation in QNH values in the Singapore FIR does not exceed 10hPa either side of the standard
setting 1013.2hPa, representing a change of about 300ft on the altimeter from QNH to 1013.2hPa. To simplify
ATC procedures, therefore, a transition level of FL130 has been established, thus providing a transition layer
of 2,000ft and ensuring at all times the 1,000ft vertical separation between aircraft.

1.3

No aircraft should therefore flight plan to cruise at flight levels 115, 120 and 125 when operating in the Singapore
Flight Information Region.

1.4

AREA QNH ZONES (AQZ)

1.4.1

Within the airspace in the Singapore FIR.

1.5

AREA QNH

1.5.1

AREA QNH is the forecast value of the LOWEST mean sea level pressure within the AQZ, valid for a period of
6 hours. e.g. AREA QNH valid 0600-1200.

1.5.2

AREA QNH as defined above, is one of the types of MET data required for the determination of the lowest flight
level which will ensure adequate terrain clearance at any location within the AQZ during the period of validity.

1.5.3

Amendments are issued by MET when the mean sea level pressure at any location in the AQZ is expected to
fall below the current AREA QNH by more than 2hPa, and units responsible for airspace in which aircraft could
be operating on AREA QNH shall broadcast the amended value on all air/ground frequencies in use.

2

BASIC ALTIMETER SETTING PROCEDURES

2.1

Altimeter Setting Procedures

2.1.1

For flight at or below the transition altitude, the altimeter reference will be the AREA QNH. Flight will therefore
be conducted in altitudes.

2.1.2

Change from LOCAL QNH (set for departure) to AREA QNH will be made on leaving the Singapore/Johor
Airspace Complex or Aerodrome Traffic Zone after take-off.

2.1.3

Change from AREA QNH to LOCAL QNH will be made on entering Terminal Control Area or Aerodrome Traffic
Zone or on commencement of final approach to land.

2.1.4

For flight at and above the transition level, the standard altimeter setting of 1013.2hPa will be used.

2.1.5

Change from AREA QNH to 1013.2hPa will be made on climb through the transition altitude.

2.1.6

Change from 1013.2hPa to AREA QNH will be made on descent through the transition level.

2.1.7

Cruising within the transition layer is not permitted unless specifically cleared by the ACC of that FIR.

2.1.8

Vertical displacement of aircraft when at or below the transition is expressed in terms of altitude whereas such
displacement at or above the transition level is expressed in terms of flight level. While passing through the
transition layer, vertical displacement is expressed in terms of altitude when descending and in terms of flight
level when ascending.

2.1.9

Flight Level zero is located at the atmospheric pressure level of 1013.2hPa. Consecutive flight levels are separated
by a pressure level corresponding to 500ft in the Standard Atmosphere.

2.2

TAKE-OFF AND CLIMB

2.2.1

A QNH altimeter setting shall be made available to aircraft by Approach/Aerodrome Control in the routine takeoff and climb instructions.

2.2.2

Vertical displacement of aircraft during climb shall be effected by reference to altitude until reaching the transition
altitude above which vertical displacement shall be effected by reference to flight level.

2.2.3

A QFE altimeter setting will be made available on request but reports to ATC are to be made in altitudes.

2.3

VERTICAL SEPARATION - ENROUTE

2.3.1

Aircraft en-route in the Singapore FIR (irrespective of whether IFR or VFR) shall be flown at flight levels or
altitudes where appropriate.

2.3.2

It is the pilots’ responsibility to select a flight level which will give adequate terrain clearance using forecast
pressure information.

2.3.3

For the purpose of en-route vertical separation IFR and VFR flights within controlled airspace and flights in
uncontrolled airspace of the Singapore FIR, reference should be made to the following:
a.
b.
c.

Semi-circular system of cruising levels within all controlled airspace (IFR flights) (page ENR 1.7-4);
VFR flights cruising levels up to FL150 within controlled airspace (page ENR 1.7-5);
Quadrantal cruising levels in uncontrolled airspace of the Singapore FIR (page ENR 1.7-5).

2.4

APPROACH AND LANDING

2.4.1

A QNH altimeter setting shall be made available in the routine approach and landing instructions.

2.4.2

A QFE altimeter setting will be made available on request but reports to ATC are to be made in altitude.

2.4.3

Vertical displacement of aircraft during approach is effected by reference to flight level until reaching the transition
level below which vertical displacement is controlled by reference to altitude.

2.5

MISSED APPROACH

2.5.1

The relevant portions of paragraphs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 shall be applied in case of a missed approach.

RVSM OPERATIONAL APPROVAL AND MONITORING

1.2.1

Operators must obtain airworthiness and operational approval from the State of Registry or State of the Operator,
as appropriate, to conduct RVSM operations. The requirement for operators to qualify for RVSM operational
approval can be found at:
http://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Safety/Advisory_Circulars/
AC-AOC_series-AIR_Operators/AC_AOC-15_0.pdf
Each aircraft operating in RVSM airspace shall hold a valid RVSM approval. RVSM approval issued for one
region will always be valid for RVSM operations in another region provided specific restrictions have not been
imposed on the operator by the State of the Operator or State of Registry. The Monitoring Agency for Asia
Region (MAAR) monitors operator compliance with State approvals requirements by performing periodic scrutiny
checks using Traffic Sample Data and the RVSM approvals record (http://www.aerothai.co.th/maar/approvals.php)

1.2.2

AIP Singapore

Operators are required to participate in the RVSM aircraft monitoring program. This is an essential element of
the RVSM implementation program in that it confirms that the aircraft altitude-keeping performance standard
is being met. Monitoring accomplished for other regions can be used to fulfil the monitoring requirements for the
Asia/Pacific Region. The information on height-keeping performance monitoring options can be found at:
http://www.aerothai.co.th/maar/monitoringsystems.php

1.3

ACAS II AND TRANSPONDER EQUIPAGE

1.3.1

Aircraft operating in RVSM airspace shall be equipped with an airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS II)
and to operate the ACAS system in accordance with the relevant provisions of ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV,
Chapter 4.

1.4

IN-FLIGHT PROCEDURES WITHIN RVSM AIRSPACE

1.4.1

Before entering RVSM airspace, the pilot should review the status of required equipment. The following equipment
should be operating normally:
a.
b.
c.

1.4.2

two primary altimetry systems;
one automatic altitude-keeping device; and
one altitude-alerting device.

The pilot must notify ATC whenever the aircraft:
a.
b.
c.

is no longer RVSM compliant due to equipment failure; or
experiences loss of redundancy of altimetry systems; or
encounters turbulence that affects the capability to maintain flight level.

See pages ENR 1.8-8 to ENR 1.8-11 or Appendix 5 of FAA IG 91-RVSM for pilot and controller actions in
contingency scenarios.
1.4.3

During cleared transition between levels, the aircraft should not overshoot or undershoot the assigned FL by
more than 150ft (45m).

1.4.4

Except in an ADS or radar environment, pilots shall report reaching any altitude assigned within RVSM airspace.

1.4.5

Paragraphs 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 below contain procedures for in-flight contingencies that have been updated
for RVSM operations. The contingency procedures in paragraphs 1.5 and 1.6 and the off-set procedures in
paragraph 1.8 should be applied in Oceanic operations. The weather deviation procedures in paragraph 1.7
may be applied in all airspace in the region.

1.5

SPECIAL PROCEDURES FOR IN-FLIGHT CONTINGENCIES IN OCEANIC AIRSPACE
IN THE SINGAPORE FIR

1.5.1

The following general procedures apply to both subsonic and supersonic aircraft and are intended as guidance
only. Although all possible contingencies cannot be covered, they provide for cases of inability to maintain
assigned level due to:
a.
b.
c.
d.

weather;
aircraft performance;
pressurisation failure; and
problems associated with high-level supersonic flight.

1.5.2

The procedures are applicable primarily when rapid descent and/or turn-back or diversion to an alternate airport
is required. The pilot’s judgement shall determine the sequence of actions to be taken, taking into account
specific circumstances.

1.5.3

If an aircraft is unable to continue flight in accordance with its air traffic control clearance, a revised clearance
shall, whenever possible, be obtained prior to initiating any action, using a distress or urgency signal as
appropriate.

1.5.4

If prior clearance cannot be obtained, an ATC clearance shall be obtained at the earliest possible time and, until
a revised clearance is received, the pilot shall:
a.
b.

c.
d.
AIP AMDT 05/2019

if possible, deviate away from an organised track or route system;
establish communications with and alert nearby aircraft by broadcasting, at suitable intervals: flight
identification, flight level, aircraft position (including the ATS route designator or the track code) and
intentions on the frequency in use, as well as on frequency 121.5MHz (or, as a back-up, the VHF inter-pilot
air-to-air frequency 123.45MHz);
watch for conflicting traffic both visually and by reference to ACAS (if equipped); and
turn on all aircraft exterior lights (commensurate with appropriate operating limitations).

IN-FLIGHT CONTINGENCY PROCEDURES FOR SUBSONIC AIRCRAFT REQUIRING
RAPID DESCENT, TURN-BACK OR DIVERSION IN OCEANIC AIRSPACE IN THE
SINGAPORE FIR
Initial action

1.6.1

If unable to comply with the provisions of 1.5.3 to obtain a revised ATC clearance, the aircraft should leave its
assigned route or track by turning 45 degrees right or left whenever this is possible. The direction of the turn
should be determined by the position of the aircraft relative to any organised route or track system (for example,
whether the aircraft is outside, at the edge of, or within the system). Other factors to consider are terrain clearance
and the levels allocated to adjacent routes or tracks.
Subsequent action

1.6.2

An aircraft able to maintain its assigned level should acquire and maintain in either direction a track laterally
separated by 15NM from its assigned route or track and once established on the offset track, climb or descend
500ft (150m).

1.6.3

An aircraft NOT able to maintain its assigned level should, whenever possible, minimise its rate of descent while
turning to acquire and maintain in either direction a track laterally separated by 15NM from its assigned route
or track. For subsequent level flight, a level should be selected which differs by 500ft (150m) from those normally
used.

1.6.4

Before commencing a diversion across the flow of adjacent traffic, the aircraft should, while maintaining the
15NM offset, expedite climb above or descend below levels where the majority of aircraft operate (e.g. to a level
above FL400 or below FL290) and then maintain a level which differs by 500ft (150m) from those normally used.
However, if the pilot is unable or unwilling to carry out a major climb or descent, the aircraft should be flown at
a level 500ft above or below levels normally used until a new ATC clearance is obtained.

1.6.5

If these contingency procedures are employed by a twin-engine aircraft as a result of an engine shutdown or a
failure of an ETOPS critical system, the pilot should advise ATC as soon as practicable of the situation, reminding
ATC of the type of aircraft involved and requesting expeditious handling.

1.7

WEATHER DEVIATION PROCEDURES IN THE SINGAPORE FIR
General procedures

1.7.1

The following procedures are intended to provide guidance. All possible circumstances cannot be covered. The
pilot’s judgement shall ultimately determine the sequence of actions taken and ATC shall render all possible
assistance.

1.7.2

If the aircraft is required to deviate from track to avoid weather and prior clearance cannot be obtained, an air
traffic control clearance shall be obtained at the earliest possible time. In the meantime, the aircraft shall follow
the procedures detailed in paragraph 1.7.9.

1.7.3

The pilot shall advise ATC when weather deviation is no longer required, or when a weather deviation has been
completed and the aircraft has returned to the centreline of its cleared route.

1.7.4

When the pilot initiates communications with ATC, rapid response may be obtained by stating “WEATHER
DEVIATION REQUIRED” to indicate that priority is desired on the frequency and for ATC response.

1.7.5

The pilot still retains the option of initiating the communications using the urgency call “PAN PAN” to alert all
listening parties to a special handling condition, which may receive ATC priority for issuance of a clearance or
assistance.

1.7.6

When controller-pilot communications are established, the pilot shall notify ATC and request clearance to deviate
from track, advising, when possible, the extent of the deviation expected. ATC will take one of the following
actions:
a.

if there is no conflicting traffic in the horizontal dimension, ATC will issue clearance to deviate from track;
or

b.

if there is conflicting traffic in the horizontal dimension, ATC will separate aircraft by establishing vertical
separation or, if unable to establish vertical separation, ATC shall:
i.
ii.
iii.

advise the pilot unable to issue clearance for requested deviation
advise pilot of conflicting traffic
request pilot’s intentions

aircraft.)
if necessary, establish voice communications with ATC to expedite dialogue on the situation.

Actions to be taken if a revised air traffic control clearance cannot be obtained
1.7.8

The pilot shall take the actions listed below under the provision that the pilot may deviate from rules of the air
(e.g. the requirement to operate on route or track centreline unless otherwise directed by ATC), when it is
absolutely necessary in the interests of safety to do so.

1.7.9

If a revised air traffic control clearance cannot be obtained and deviation from track is required to avoid weather,
the pilot shall take the following actions:
a.

if possible, deviate away from an organised track or route system;

b.

establish communications with and alert nearby aircraft by broadcasting, at suitable intervals: flight
identification, flight level, aircraft position (including the ATS route designator or the track code) and
intentions (including the magnitude of the deviation expected) on the frequency in use, as well as on
frequency 121.5MHz (or, as a back-up, the VHF inter-pilot air-to-air frequency 123.45MHz).

c.

watch for conflicting traffic both visually and by reference to ACAS (if equipped);

d.

turn on all aircraft exterior lights (commensurate with appropriate operating limitations);

e.

for deviations of less than 10NM, aircraft should remain at the level assigned by ATC;

Note: Items b) and c) call for the pilot to broadcast aircraft position and pilot’s intentions, identify conflicting
traffic and communicate air-to-air with nearby aircraft.
If the pilot determines that there is another aircraft at or near the same FL with which his aircraft might
conflict, then the pilot is expected to adjust the path of the aircraft, as necessary, to avoid conflict.

g.

if contact was not established prior to deviating, continue to attempt to contact ATC to obtain a clearance.
If contact was established, continue to keep ATC advised of intentions and obtain essential traffic
information.

h.

when returning to track, be at its assigned flight level when the aircraft is within approximately 10NM of
centreline.

1.8

PROCEDURES TO MITIGATE WAKE TURBULENCE ENCOUNTERS AND DISTRACTING
AIRCRAFT SYSTEM ALERTS IN THE OCEANIC AIRSPACE OF SINGAPORE FIR

1.8.1

The following special procedures are applicable to mitigate wake turbulence or distracting aircraft system alerts
[e.g. ACAS, Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS)] in Asia and Pacific airspace where RVSM is applied:
NOTE: In the contingency circumstances below, ATC will not issue clearances for lateral offsets and will not
normally respond to actions taken by the pilots.

1.8.2

ENR 1.8-5
15 AUG 2019

An aircraft that encounters wake vortex turbulence or experiences distracting aircraft system alerts shall notify
ATC and request a flight level, track or speed change to avoid the condition. However, in situations where such
a change is not possible or practicable, the pilot may initiate the following temporary lateral offset procedure
with the intention of returning to centreline as soon as practicable:
a.

the pilot should establish contact with other aircraft, if possible, on the appropriate VHF inter-pilot air-to-air
frequency 123.45MHz, and

b.

one (or both) aircraft may initiate lateral offset(s) not to exceed 2NM from the assigned track, provided
that:
i.

as soon as practicable to do so, the offsetting aircraft notify ATC that temporary lateral offset action
has been taken and specify the reason for doing so (ATC will not normally respond); and

ii.

the offsetting aircraft notify ATC when re-established on assigned route(s) or track(s) (ATC will not
normally respond).

1.9

MACH NUMBER TECHNIQUE (MNT) AND AREA NAVIGATION (RNAV)

2.1

INTRODUCTION

2.1.1

RNAV is a method which permits aircraft navigation along any desired flight path within the coverage of the
associated navigation aids, or within the limits of the capability of self-contained aids, or a combination of these
methods. RNAV equipment is considered to be that equipment which operates by automatically determining
aircraft position from one, or a combination of the following sensors with the means to establish and follow a
desired path: VOR/DME, DME/DME, INS, LORAN C, GNSS.

2.1.2

Only aircraft equipped with RNAV systems would be able to operate on the RNAV routes in the revised South
China Sea ATS route structure which forms part of the Singapore FIR. Aircraft that are not RNAV compliant will
only be cleared to operate on non-RNAV routes.

2.1.3

The requirements for conduct of RNAV operations are stated in ICAO Doc 9613 (Manual on Required Navigation
Performance) and FAA AC 90-45 (Approval of Area Navigation Systems for use in the US National Airspace
System).

STRATEGIC LATERAL OFFSET PROCEDURES

5.1

INTRODUCTION

5.1.1

Studies and safety analyses conducted by the ICAO Separation and Airspace Safety Panel (SASP) have shown
that the application of a strategic lateral offset by aircraft from route centre line would result in an overall increase
in safety of operations in remote and oceanic airspace.

5.2

STRATEGIC LATERAL OFFSETS IN EN-ROUTE AIRSPACE

5.2.1

Offsets may only be applied outside surveillance cover in en-route airspace within the Singapore FIR.

5.2.2

Offsets may only be applied by aircraft with automatic offset tracking capability.

5.2.3

The following requirements may apply to the use of the offset:
a.

The decision to apply a strategic lateral offset is the responsibility of the flight crew;

b.

The offset shall be established at a distance of one or two nautical miles to the right of the centre line
relative to the direction of flight. Offsets are not to exceed two nautical miles right of centre line;

c.

The strategic lateral offset procedure has been designed to include offsets to mitigate the effects of wake
turbulence of preceding aircraft. If wake turbulence needs to be avoided, offsets to the right of the centreline
relative to the direction of flight in tenths of a nautical mile up to a maximum of 3.7km (2nm) shall be used.
Pilots may contact other aircraft on the air to air frequency, 123.45MHz, as necessary, to coordinate
the best wake turbulence offset option. As noted below, it is not necessary to notify air traffic control of
approved offsets;

d.

In airspace where the use of lateral offsets has been authorized, ATC clearance is not required for this
procedure and pilots are not required to inform ATC that an offset is being applied;

e.

Position reports are based on the current ATC clearance and not the exact coordinates of the offset
position.
An example of a position report made by a pilot when passing reporting point TODAM while being offset
from track is:
“Singapore Radio, Singapore 871, position TODAM 0930 Flight Level 380, estimate.....etc”.

6.3

ARRIVING AIRCRAFT TO SINGAPORE CHANGI AIRPORT

6.3.1

STANDARD INSTRUMENT ARRIVAL (STAR)
IFR flight should expect a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR). Changi arrivals via ATS route A464 shall flight
plan ARAMA STAR route. LELIB STAR would be issued to pilots when traffic permits. ATC may also clear
arrivals to join the LEBAR STAR when air traffic permits to facilitate arrivals joining downwind to the west of
Singapore Changi Airport.

6.3.2

ENTRY GATE TIME
To regulate the flow of traffic into the Approach airspace, ATC will issue, when necessary, a time restriction at
an entry gate associated with the inbound route of the flight into Singapore Changi Airport.

6.3.3

DESCENT PROFILE
Pilots shall plan their descent profile in accordance to the published STAR procedures.

6.3.4

SPEED CONTROL
Speed control restrictions are incorporated into the STARs toenhance predictability and planning of air traffic
in the Approach airspace. Pilots shall adhere to the speed control restrictions published in the STAR procedures
unless otherwise advised. ATC may issue further speed adjustment during the different phases of the flight if
traffic situation warrants.

6.4

APPROACH AIRSPACE HOLDING PROCEDURES

6.4.1

ENTRY PROCEDURE
The entry into the holding patterns shall be in accordance with the three-sector entry procedure as prescribed
in ICAO Doc 8168 - OPS/611 Edition 1993.

6.4.2

RATE OF TURN
All turns are to be made at a bank angle of 25° or at a rate of 3° per second, whichever requires the lesser
bank.

6.4.3

DESCENT PROCEDURE
When instructed to join a holding pattern, pilots shall reach their assigned altitudes prior to arriving at the holding
point. This will allow appropriate traffic sequencing and the reduction of step-descents in the holding pattern.

AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT CONTINGENCY PLAN

8.1

INTRODUCTION

8.1.1

The Air Traffic Management (ATM) Contingency Plan for Singapore FIR has been developed to fulfil the
requirements of the ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices contained in Annex 11 and the Regional
Supplementary Procedures (Doc 7030). In the event of partial or total disruption to the provision of Air Traffic
Services (ATS) and / or the related support services in the Singapore Flight Information Region (FIR), the ATM
Contingency Plan referred to in this section shall be activated to ensure the continued safety of air navigation
of aircraft operating through the Singapore FIR.

AIP AMDT 05/2019

ENR 1.8-22
15 AUG 2019

AIP Singapore

8.1.2

However, this contingency plan does not address arrangements for aircraft arriving and departing at Singapore
airports. Aircraft departing or landing at Changi operating within 60NM from Singapore will be subjected to
contingency procedures stated in ENR 1.8 paragraphs 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8.

8.1.3

This ATM Contingency Plan provides:
a.

the contingency routes structure using existing published airways to enable transit through the Singapore
FIR; and

b.

the associated Air Traffic Control (ATC) procedures to support the contingency plan.

8.1.4

As and where dictated by circumstances, aircraft planning to operate through Singapore FIR that have not yet
departed may be temporarily suspended until a full assessment of the prevailing conditions has been determined
and sufficient air traffic services restored.

8.1.5

Long-haul international aircraft and special operations (e.g. Search and Rescue (SAR), State aircraft, humanitarian
flights, etc.) shall be afforded priority for levels at FL290 and above. Aircraft operators that operate domestic
and regional flights should plan on the basis that FL290 and above may not be available.

8.1.6

Aircraft operators may elect to avoid the Singapore FIR by using ATS routes outside of Singapore FIR.

8.2

REDUCED ATS AND PROVISION OF FLIGHT INFORMATION SERVICES (FIS)

8.2.1

During the period where the contingency arrangements are in place, ATS including ATC services may not be
available, a NOTAM will be issued providing the relevant information. The contingency plan provides for limited
flight information and alerting services to be provided by Singapore ACC.

8.2.2

FIS and flight monitoring will be provided by the designated ATS authorities for the adjacent FIRs on the
contingency routes that enter their respective FIRs.

8.2.3

During the early stages of a contingency event, ATC may be overloaded and tactical action may be taken to
re-clear aircraft on alternative routes not included in this Plan.

8.2.4

In the event that ATS cannot be provided in the Singapore FIR, a NOTAM shall be issued indicating the following:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
g.
h.

time and date on the commencement of the contingency measures;
airspace available for aircraft operations and airspace to be avoided;
details of the facilities and services available or not available and any limits on ATS provision, including
an expected date of restoration of services if available;
information on the provisions made for alternative services;
applicable ATS routes, AIP-published contingency routes, or tactically defined contingency routes;
any special procedures to be complied by neighbouring ATS units not covered by this Plan;
any special procedures to be complied by pilots; and
any other details that aircraft operators may find useful with respect to the disruption and actions taken.

8.2.5

In the event that the Singapore International NOTAM Office is unable to issue the NOTAM, the alternate
International NOTAM Office will take action to issue the contingency NOTAM upon notification by CAAS.

8.3

AIRCRAFT SEPARATION AND SPACING

8.3.1

Aircraft separation criteria, where applicable, will be in accordance with the ICAO Procedures for Air Navigation
Services - Air Traffic Management (PANS-ATM, Doc 4444) and the Regional Supplementary Procedures (Doc
7030).

8.3.2

The longitudinal separation / spacing will be 15 minutes. However, this may be reduced to 10 minutes in
conjunction with application of the Mach number technique where authorized by CAAS and the agreed ATS
coordination with the adjacent ATS authority.

8.3.3

The contingency route structure provides for lateral separation / spacing of 100NM. In cases where the lateral
spacing of contingency routes is less than 100NM, a minimum vertical separation of 1000 feet will be applicable.

8.4

PRIORITY FOR FLIGHT LEVELS

8.4.1

Where possible, aircraft on long-haul international flights shall be afforded priority for cruising levels assigned
in accordance with the flight level allocation scheme as specified in paragraph 8.10.

8.5

AIRSPACE CLASSIFICATIONS

8.5.1

Depending on the degree of disruption, airspace classifications may be changed to reflect the reduced level of
services. Changes to airspace classification will be notified via NOTAM.

AIRCRAFT POSITION REPORTING

8.6.1

Beyond VHF coverage, Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Contract (ADS-C) shall replace any requirement
for voice position reporting to ATC for suitably equipped aircraft and in this case Controller-Pilot Data Link
Communications (CPDLC) or HF will be the secondary means of communication. When CPDLC has been
authorised for use by the relevant ATC authority, this will become the primary means of communication while
HF will act as the secondary means of communication. If means of communication (i.e. ADS-C, CPDLC, HF,
VHF) are not available, aircraft operators shall comply with the communications procedures as stated in paragraph
8.9.

8.6.2

In the event that communication with the appropriate ATS authority could not be established, aircraft operators
may apply Traffic Information Broadcast by Aircraft (TIBA) procedures in the Singapore FIR as outline in
paragraph 8.11 on 121.5MHz.

8.7

EXCLUSIONS

8.7.1

VFR flights shall not operate in the Singapore FIR during contingency operations, except for State aircraft,
Medevac flights, and any other aircraft as authorised by CAAS.

8.8

level. However, this may be reduced to 10 minutes in conjunction with application of the Mach number
technique where authorized by CAAS and the agreed ATS coordination with the adjacent ATS authority;
and
not all operational circumstances can be addressed by this Contingency Plan and pilots are to maintain
a high level of alertness when operating in the contingency airspace and take appropriate action to ensure
safety of aircraft.

8.8.4

Interception of civil aircraft

8.8.4.1

Aircraft operators must be familiar with international intercept procedures contained in ICAO Annex 2 - Rules
of the Air, paragraph 3.8 and Appendix 2, Sections 2 and 3.

8.8.4.2

Pilots are to comply with instructions given by the pilot of the intercepting aircraft. In such circumstances, the
pilot of the aircraft being intercepted shall broadcast information on the situation.

8.8.4.3

will be required to keep clear of Singapore FIR. As much warning as possible will be provided by the appropriate
ATS authorities in the event of the complete closure of airspace.

8.8.4.4

Pilots shall continuously guard the VHF emergency frequency 121.5MHz and shall operate their transponder
at all times during flight, regardless of whether the aircraft is within or outside airspace where secondary
surveillance radar (SSR) is used for ATS purposes. Transponder should be set on the last discrete code assigned
by ATC or select Code 2000 if no code was assigned.

8.9

COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES

8.9.1

Degradation of Communication - Pilot Radio Procedures

8.9.1.1

When operating within the contingency airspace, pilots should use normal radio communication procedures
where ATS services are available. Where limited or no ATS is available, communications shall be conducted
in accordance with the procedures in this Plan or as otherwise notified by NOTAM.

8.9.1.2

If communications are lost unexpectedly on the normal ATS frequencies, pilots shall try the next applicable
frequency, e.g. if en-route contact is lost, pilots shall try the next appropriate frequency (the next normal handover
frequency). Pilots should also consider attempting to contact ATC on the last frequency where two-way
communication had been established. In the absence of communication with ATC, the pilot shall continue to
make routine position reports on the assigned frequency, and also broadcast positions in accordance with the
TIBA procedures in paragraph 8.11.

TRAFFIC INFORMATION BROADCASTS BY AIRCRAFT (TIBA)

8.11.1

Introduction and applicability of broadcasts

8.11.1.1

Traffic information broadcasts by aircraft are intended to permit reports and relevant supplementary information
of an advisory nature to be transmitted by pilots on a designated VHF radiotelephone (RTF) frequency for the
information of pilots of other aircraft in the vicinity.

8.11.1.2

TIBAs shall be introduced only when necessary and as a temporary measure.

8.11.1.3

The broadcast procedures shall be applied in designated airspace where:

8.11.1.4

a.

there is a need to supplement collision hazard information provided by air traffic services outside controlled
airspace; or

b.

there is a temporary disruption of normal air traffic services.

Such airspaces shall be identified by the States responsible for provision of air traffic services within these
airspaces, if necessary with the assistance of the appropriate ICAO Regional Office(s), and duly promulgated
in aeronautical information publications or NOTAM, together with the VHF RTF frequency, the message formats
and the procedures to be used. Where, in the case of paragraph 8.11.1.3 a., more than one State is involved,
the airspace should be designated on the basis of regional air navigation agreements and promulgated in Doc
7030.

© 2019 Civil Aviation Authority Singapore

AIP AMDT 05/2019

ENR 1.8-28
15 AUG 2019

AIP Singapore

8.11.1.5

When establishing a designated airspace, dates for the review of its applicability at intervals not exceeding 12
months should be agreed by the appropriate ATS authority(ies).

8.11.2

Details of broadcasts
VHF RTF frequency to be used

8.11.2.1

The VHF RTF frequency to be used shall be determined and promulgated on a regional basis. However, in the
case of temporary disruption occurring in controlled airspace, the States responsible may promulgate, as the
VHF RTF frequency to be used within the limits of that airspace, a frequency used normally for the provision of

AIR TRAFFIC FLOW MANAGEMENT (ATFM)

1.1

ATFM is a service to complement the safe, orderly and efficient delivery of Air Traffic Services (ATS) by regulating
air traffic flow to match the prevailing capacity at a given airport or airspace. Through ATFM, airspace users
(AUs) and ATS units (ATSUs) can be made aware of predicted delays so that timely adjustment to operations
and flight schedules could be made accordingly. ATFM measure such as Ground Delay Programme (GDP),
Minimum Departure Interval (MDI) and Miles- in-Trail (MIT) are some of the methods to achieve the objectives
of ATFM as defined in ICAO’s Manual on Collaborative ATFM (Doc 9971).

1.2

For Singapore FIR, ATFM services are provided by Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) from the
Singapore ATFM Unit (ATFMU) operating on a 24-hour basis. The services comprise the planning and
implementation of ATFM measures to balance demand and capacity. The review of the effectiveness of ATFM
measures are carried out through the conduct of post operation analysis. The implementation of ATFM measures
will be coordinated with AUs and ATSUs through Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) processes and agreed
operating procedures.

ATFM OPERATIONS FOR FLIGHTS ARRIVING AT SINGAPORE CHANGI AIRPORT

2.1

Where necessary, ATFM measures will be applied for flights scheduled to arrive at Singapore Changi Airport
(WSSS).

2.2

Flights departing from the following airports may be subjected to ATFM measures:
ANSP
Cambodia
China
Hong Kong
Indonesia
Malaysia
Myanmar
Philippines
Thailand
Vietnam

VTBS, VTSP, VTBD, VTCC, VTCT, VTSB, VTSG, VTSM, VTSP, VTSS, VTUD
VVTS, VVNB

2.3

When ATFM measures are applied, the Singapore ATFMU will assign Calculated Take-Off Times (CTOTs) to
flights departing from the airports listed in paragraph 2.2 planning to arrive into Singapore Changi Airport.

2.4

AUs and ATSUs are advised to refer to the Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) Portal to access CTOTs
and/or other pertinent ATFM information via the Civil Aviation Authority Singapore (CAAS) Webpage, link
provided: http://www.caas.gov.sg/e-services/air-traffic-flow-management

2.5

Compliance to CTOT during the ATFM operation is important, it contributes to the realisation of the ATFM plan.
It would assist in the reduction of the need for tactical airborne delay, promoting a safer and more efficient
operating environment for AOs and AUs.

2.6

All AUs planning to arrive into WSSS shall:
i.
ii.
iii.

file and submit FPLs at least 3 hours before the Estimated Off Block Time (EOBT);
transmit the appropriate ATS messages (CHG / DLA) when the EOBT changes by more than 15 minutes;
and
transmit CNL message if the flight is cancelled after the submission of FPL.

2.7

FPLs and ATS messages shall be addressed to WSJCZQZX.

3

ATFM OPERATIONS FOR FLIGHTS PLANNING TO OPERATE WITHIN THE
SINGAPORE FIR

3.1

The Singapore ATFMU may implement ATFM measures to facilitate ATC of flow restrictions originated by
downstream ATSUs, with the aim to provide a higher level of predictability for AUs and affected upstream ATSUs
when operating in the Singapore FIR. For example, flow restriction on a given ATS route in a form of
Minutes-in-trail MINIT at downstream segments would be converted into CTOT, and/or Calculated Time Over
(CTO) at a given waypoint within the Singapore FIR.

3.2

AIP Singapore

Procedures for flight plan submission for such ATFM facilitation would be coordinated tactically by the Singapore
ATFMU with AUs and affected upstream ATSUs. The transmit of the appropriate ATS messages would take
reference from para 2.6 in the above.
Note: In general, Singapore ATFMU would request for FPL to be filed and submitted within 1 hour from the
notification of the activation of ATFM measure.

3.3

FPLs and ATS messages should be addressed to WSJCZQZX.

BAY OF BENGAL COOPERATIVE ATFM (BOBCAT)

5.1

INTRODUCTION

5.1.1

The States of the ICAO Asia/Pacific Region within the Bay of Bengal, South Asia and Pakistan airspace have
implemented an automated Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) service under the auspices of the ICAO Bay
of Bengal ATS Coordination Group - ATFM Task Force.

5.2

PROVISION OF ATFM SERVICES

5.2.1

ATFM services are provided by Aeronautical Radio of Thailand LTD (AEROTHAI) from the Bangkok Air Traffic
Flow Management Unit (ATFMU) at Bangkok ACC. ATFM services will be limited to calculation, promulgation
and management of mandatory Calculated Take-Off Time (CTOT) and Kabul FIR flight level, ATS route and
entry fix time, Calculated Time-Over (CTO) for each affected flight.

5.2.2

Singapore ATC retains responsibility for the tactical management of flights that are subject to ATFM. In
discharging tactical responsibilities, Singapore ATC will manage non-ATFM compliant flights using delayed
pushback and start clearances, non-preferred routes and/or flight levels, enroute holding and/or diversion around
Kabul FIR.

5.2.3

The ATFMU utilises the automated web based Bay of Bengal Cooperative ATFM System (BOBCAT) system
in meeting its ATFM responsibilities. These responsibilities will be managed in coordination with aircraft operators
and Singapore ATC in the Singapore FIR.

5.2.4

The ATFMU operates on a 24-hour basis and is responsible for westbound flights entering the Kabul FIR at
specified times, flight levels and ATS routes in accordance with paragraph 2.3. The objectives of these ATFM
services are to:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.

AIP AMDT 01/2020

reduce ground and en-route delays;
maximise capacity and optimize the flow of air traffic through Kabul FIR;
provide an informed choice of routing and flight level selection;
alleviate unplanned in-flight re-routing and technical stops; and
assist regional Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) in planning for and managing future workload
in the light of forecast increased traffic flows through Kabul FIR.

5.3.2

Flights that plan to enter Kabul FIR without an ATFM slot allocation will be accommodated only after flights with
slots have been processed. Such flights should expect delayed pushback and start clearances, non- preferred
routes and/or flight levels, enroute holding and/or diversion around Kabul FIR.

5.3.3

In order to ensure availability of slots for westbound departures from designated airports in northern India and
Pakistan, departures from these airports are given priority for FL280 in the slot allocation. This does not preclude
these flights from requesting higher flight levels with initial slot request.

5.3.4

The following flights are exempted from the ATFM procedures:
a.
b.
c.
d.

Flights experiencing an emergency, including aircraft subjected to unlawful interference;
Flights on search and rescue or firefighting missions;
Urgent medical evacuation flights or humanitarian flights specifically declared by State medical authorities
that flight delays would put the life of patients aboard at risk; and
Flights with “Head of State” status.

Note: After medical flights have completed their mission, they should be subjected to ATFM measures. Scheduled
passenger transfer flights are, by their nature, non-urgent and should not be given priority under normal operational
situation.
5.3.5

Flights exempted from ATFM procedures shall indicate the exemption in their flight plan as follows: (Field 18 ATFM EXMP).

5.3.6

Singapore AIS shall forward the flight plan information to Bangkok ATFMU at AFTN address VTBBZDZX.

5.4

MANDATORY CTOT AND KABUL FIR SLOT ALLOCATION

5.4.1

Affected flights shall obtain the mandatory Kabul FIR slot allocation - CTOT, CTO at Kabul FIR entry waypoint,
allocated flight level and allocated ATS route from the BOBCAT system. The CTOT and Kabul slot allocation
will enable ANSPs to tactically control westbound flights transiting the Kabul FIR at specified times by assigning
minimum spacing requirements at established gateway fix points in the vicinity of the eastern boundary of the
Kabul FIR.

5.4.2

The application, calculation and distribution of CTOT and Kabul FIR entry waypoint slot allocations will be
managed via internet access to the BOBCAT system in accordance with the ATFM operating procedures in
paragraph 2.5.

5.5

BOBCAT OPERATING PROCEDURES

5.5.1

All affected flights are required to submit their slot requests to the BOBCAT system by logging onto
https://www.bobcat.aero between 0100UTC and 1159UTC on the day of flight and completing the electronic
templates provided.

5.5.2

Affected aircraft operators who do not have dedicated BOBCAT username / password access should complete
the application form provided and fax it to the ATFMU as soon as possible.

5.6

SLOT ALLOCATION PROCESS

5.6.1

The slot allocation process is divided into 3 phases, namely the slot request submission, initial slot allocation
and finally the slot distribution to aircraft operators and ANSPs.
Slot Request Submission

© 2020 Civil Aviation Authority Singapore

AIP AMDT 01/2020

ENR 1.9-4
30 JAN 2020

AIP Singapore

5.6.2

Slot requests including preferred ATS route, flight level and Maximum Acceptable Delay (MAD) should be lodged
between 0001UTC and 1159UTC on the day of flight. Slot requests may subsequently be amended prior
1200UTC, which is the cut-off time. Aircraft operators are encouraged to submit additional slot request options
in case their first choice is not available. This may include variations to ATS route, flight level and MAD.

5.6.3

Slot requests shall be for flight parameters that are able to be met by the flight. For example, flights requesting
a slot at FL390 must be able to transit Kabul FIR at FL390. Flights subsequently unable to meet the slot
parameters (flight level, ATS route or CTO at entry waypoint) should expect non-preferred routes and / or flight
levels, enroute holding and / or diversion around Kabul FIR.

5.6.4

As BOBCAT will allocate FL280 on a priority basis to facilitate departures from northern India and Pakistan
underneath overflying traffic, flights departing these points are encouraged to include FL280 as at least one slot
request preference.

5.6.5

Flights that were not allocated a slot in the initial slot allocation, are not satisfied with the allocated slot or did
not submit a slot request should select slots from the listing of remaining unallocated slots available immediately
after slot distribution has been completed.
Slot Allocation and Distribution

5.6.6

Slot allocation will commence at the cut-off time at 1200UTC. BOBCAT will process and generate the slot
allocation based on the information submitted in the slot requests. Notification of slot allocation will be made not
later than 1230UTC via the ATFMU website. Alternative arrangements for notification of slot distribution (e.g.
e-mail, fax, telephone) should be coordinated with the ATFMU.

5.6.7

After the slot allocation has been published at https://www.bobcat.aero, aircraft operators can:
a.

use the slot allocation result for ATS flight planning purposes;

b.

cancel the allocated slot; and / or

c.

change slot allocation to another available slot in the published list of unallocated slots.

5.6.8

Singapore ATC and AIS can also view the slot allocation results at https://www.bobcat.aero.

5.7

SUBMISSION OF ATS FLIGHT PLAN

5.7.1

Once aircraft operators are in receipt of the slot allocation, they shall submit the ATS flight plan using the time,
ATS route and flight level parameters of the BOBCAT allocated slot.

5.7.2

In addition to the normal addressees, Singapore AIS will also address the flight plan (FPL) and related ATS
messages (e.g. DLA, CNL, CHG) to the ATFMU via AFTN address VTBBZDZX for all flights that have submitted
a slot request.

5.8

AIRCRAFT OPERATOR / PILOT-IN-COMMAND AND ANSP RESPONSIBILITIES
Aircraft Operator / Pilot-in-Command

5.8.1

In accordance with ICAO PANS-ATM provisions, it is the responsibility of the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) and the
aircraft operator to ensure that the aircraft is ready to taxi in time to meet any required departure time. PIC shall
be kept informed by their aircraft operators of the CTOT, CTO at Kabul FIR entry waypoint and flight parameters
(route / level) allocated by BOBCAT.

5.8.2

The PIC, in collaboration with ATC, shall arrange take-off as close as possible to the CTOT in order to meet the
allocated CTO at Kabul FIR entry waypoint.
ANSPs

5.8.3

In accordance with ICAO PANS-ATM provisions, flights with an ATFM slot allocation should be given priority
for take-off to facilitate compliance with the CTOT.

5.8.4

CTOT shall be included as part of the initial ATC clearance. In collaboration with PIC, Singapore ATC shall
ensure that every opportunity and assistance is granted to a flight to meet the CTOT and allocated CTO at Kabul
FIR entry waypoint.

5.9

COORDINATION BETWEEN AIRCRAFT OPERATOR / PILOT-IN-COMMAND, ANSPs
AND BANGKOK ATFMU

5.9.1

The PIC shall include the CTOT in the initial ATC clearance request.

AIP AMDT 01/2020

© 2020 Civil Aviation Authority Singapore

AIP Singapore

ENR 1.9-5
30 JAN 2020

5.9.2

PIC shall adjust cruise flight to comply with slot parameters at the Kabul FIR entry waypoint, requesting appropriate
ATC clearances including speed variations in accordance with the published AIP requirements.

5.9.3

Prior to departure, in circumstances where it becomes obvious that the allocated Kabul FIR entry waypoint slot
parameters will not be met, a new slot allocation should be obtained as soon as possible and via the most
expeditious means (e.g. via coordination between flight dispatcher, PIC, Singapore ATC and Bangkok ATFMU).
Early advice that the Kabul FIR slot parameters will be missed also enables the slots so vacated to be efficiently
reassigned to other flights.

5.9.4

Prior to departure and after the aircraft has left the gate, in the event that the aircraft is unable to meet the Kabul
FIR entry waypoint slot parameters, when requested by the PIC, Singapore ATC shall assist the PIC to coordinate
with the ATFMU for a revised slot allocation.

5.9.5

The ATFMU (VTBBZDZX) shall be included in the list of AFTN addressees for NOTAMs regarding any planned
activities that may affect slot availability (e.g. reservation of airspace / closure of airspace, non- availability of
routes, etc.).

5.9.6

The ATFMU (VTBBZDZX) shall be included in the list of AFTN addressees for ATS messages (e.g. FPL, DEP,
DLA, CHG, CNL) relating to flights subject to ATFM procedures.

5.9.7

A missed slot results in dramatically increased coordination workload for ATC and PIC and should be avoided.
To minimise coordination workload in obtaining a revised slot allocation, the following procedures are
recommended:
a.

If the flight is still at the gate, coordination should take place via aircraft operators / flight dispatchers to
ATFMU;

b.

If the flight has left the gate, coordination to ATFMU may also take place via the ATS unit presently
communicating with the flight.

5.10

BASIC COMPUTER REQUIREMENT

5.10.1

Aircraft operators and Singapore ATC are required to have computer equipment capable of connecting to the
BOBCAT website https://www.bobcat.aero via the internet and satisfying the following minimum technical

3.1

A pilot should proceed as follows regarding an incident in which he is or has been involved:
a.

during flight, use the appropriate air/ground frequency for reporting an incident of major significance,
particularly if it involves other aircraft, so as to permit the facts to be ascertained immediately;

b.

as promptly as possible after landing submit a completed “Air Traffic Incident Report Form”:
i.

for confirming a report of an incident made initially as in 3.1 a) above, or for making the initial report
on such an incident if it had not been possible to report it by radio;

ii.

for reporting an incident which did not require immediate notification at the time of occurrence.

3.2

An initial report made by radio should contain the following information:
A
Type of incident, e.g. near collision.
F
Radio call sign of aircraft making report.
J
Position, heading or route, true airspeed.
K
FL, altitude or height, and aircraft altitude.
L
IMC or VMC.
M
Time of incident, in UTC.
N
Description of other aircraft, if relevant.
O
Brief details of incident, including when appropriate, sighting distance and miss distance.

3.3

The confirmatory report on an incident of major significance initially reported by radio or the initial report on any

HELICOPTER OPERATIONS OVER SINGAPORE ISLAND

1.1

INTRODUCTION

1.1.1

The rapid building development in many parts of Singapore has made it necessary for helicopter operations to
be more stringently regulated in order to enhance safety. All helicopter operators are required to adhere strictly
to the following procedures.

1.2

RESTRICTED AREA -SINGLE-ENGINE HELICOPTER OPERATIONS RESTRICTED

1.2.1

Single-engine helicopters are restricted from operating over and within the city area enclosed in the triangle
bounded by the following locations:
a.
b.
c.

South of Rochor River/Kallang River (011817N 1035205E);
Shenton Way/Keppel Road (011623N 1035045E); and
Scotts Road/Orchard Road (011818N 1034954E).

Part of this triangle lies within the existing Restricted Area WSR38 (see charts ENR 3.4-5 and ENR 3.4-7).

1.3

ROUTEINGS

1.3.1

All helicopters must fly over water or use routes approved by the CAAS. There are two over-water and one
over-land helicopter routes.

1.3.2

These helicopter routes are to be flown in VMC and in daylight hours. They could either be flown separately or
in combination (see chart ENR 3.4-5).

1.4

OVER-WATER ROUTES

1.4.1

One of the two over-water routes is to the north of Singapore Island for helicopter flights into and out of Seletar
Aerodrome. The other route is along the southern shore of Singapore. They are as described below.

1.4.1.1

Heli-Route Alpha
This route covers the area from Johor Causeway eastbound over water along Selat Johor, following the coastline
of Singapore Island via the northern contour of Pulau Ubin and along the eastern coastline, down to Bedok Jetty
(011819N 1035632E) and vice versa. Within the vicinity of Changi Naval Base (CNB), transiting helicopters
are to keep laterally clear by tracking along the following markers located about 1km from the Naval Base (see
table below and diagram on page ENR 3.4-2).

Originates from Bedok Jetty (011819N 1035632E), following the coastline of Singapore Island via the southern
tip and contour of Sentosa towards Tuas and vice versa.
Height : Minimum 200ft AMSL or as specified by the appropriate air traffic control authority.

1.5

OVER-LAND ROUTE

1.5.1

The over-land transit route established to facilitate helicopter movements across the Singapore Island is as
follows:

1.5.1.1

Heli-Route Charlie
Originates from Johor Causeway, southbound to Murnane Reservoir (012104N1034710E) along the eastern
side of Bukit Timah Expressway. From Murnane Reservoir to Pandan Reservoir (011855N1034436E) and vice
versa. To avoid overflying built-up areas en-route by routing over open areas / nature reserve areas. Height:
Minimum 1,500ft AMSL or as specified by the appropriate air traffic control authority.

1.6

CONDITIONS GOVERNING THE USE OF HELI-ROUTE CHARLIE

1.6.1

The over-land route is established based on evidence of ground features and is therefore subject to CAAS’s
review. Approval to use the route is given with the following conditions:
a.

b.
c.

AIP AMDT 06/2017

The operator is fully satisfied that the route can be flown within the flight capability of the helicopter and
that there are adequate suitable emergency landing sites along the route when in use. It remains the
responsibility of the operator to ensure that his pilots are familiar with the route and the conditions governing
them.
The route is to be flown in VMC and in daylight hours.
Prior ATC clearance from the appropriate controlling authority must be obtained.

1.7

FLIGHTS OPERATING OUTSIDE THE ESTABLISHED ROUTEINGS

1.7.1

With the exception of an emergency situation, at all times, a helicopter shall not be operated within the Changi
Control Zone or overland and outside of Heli-Route Charlie, unless prior permission has been obtained from the
Director-General, CAAS.

1.7.2

While this requirement is not applicable for helicopter training flights operating within a designated aircraft
training area (Light Aircraft Training Areas A, B or C), flight planning requirements per paragraphs 1.1.2 and
1.1.3 in page ENR 1.10-1 remain applicable.

1.7.3

An application for permission can be submitted to caas_ats_ansp@caas.gov.sg. CAAS may ask for a flight
inspection of the proposed route and / or areas of operation. The applicant shall provide the means and bear
the cost of the flight inspection. Each case would be considered on its own merits and unless CAAS is satisfied
that there are very good justifications, approval would normally not be given.

1.8

FLIGHT PLAN REQUIREMENTS

1.8.1

For Flight Plan requirements, refer to ENR 1.10 FLIGHT PLANNING.

PROCEDURES FOR THE CONTROL OF HELICOPTER OPERATIONS AT SINGAPORE
CHANGI AIRPORT

2.1

APPROACH AND DEPARTURE PROCEDURES

2.1.1

Before entering the Changi Control Zone, a helicopter pilot is to advise Singapore Tower of his direction of
approach, distance from the airport, altitude and type of helicopter. Singapore Tower will pass to the pilot the
runway in use, QNH (QFE on request), surface wind and direction and if necessary the position of the helicopter
alighting area:
Example:

RWY 20R QNH 1008, Wind 020/7kt, light on the runway, Clear to make an approach or hold clear
of the Control Zone until advised.

2.1.2

All alightings and take-offs are to be made in a north/south direction as determined by the prevailing wind. The
approach from and the turn after take-off shall be made clear of all airport buildings, aprons and obstructions.
Requests for approach into and take-offs from Singapore Changi Airport shall be made to Singapore Tower.

2.1.3

Helicopters intending to cross the Changi Control Zone must cross the runway immediately on receipt of clearance
and cross at right angles to the runway. Helicopters would be cleared to cross the runway up to the time when
a fixed wing aircraft has reached 4NM final approach and Singapore Tower has the landing aircraft in sight. If
the weather condition is such that it is not expected that Singapore Tower can see the landing aircraft at 4NM
final approach, crossing will only be cleared up to the time the landing aircraft reports leaving the SAMKO
Holding Area or NYLON Holding Area inbound.

2.1.4

After take-off, the helicopter is to make a turn-off right or left as appropriate as soon as possible and proceed
until well clear of the Changi Control Zone. On reaching the boundary of the zone, the pilot will report ‘clearing
your zone’ and normal clearance will be given.

2.2

GROUND OR AIR TAXIING

2.2.1

After landing, the helicopter is required either to ground or air taxi via the taxiways into its allocated aircraft stand.

2.2.2

For take-offs, the helicopter will either ground or air taxi away from its aircraft stand and move out of the parking
area via taxiways to the runway or helicopter area for take-off.

2.3

ALLOCATION OF AIRCRAFT STANDS

2.3.1

The allocation of aircraft stands for helicopters rests with the Apron Control Unit. In allocating aircraft stands
the Duty Officer at the Apron Control Unit shall take into consideration the type of helicopter, stand occupancy
time and the nature of the flight i.e. passenger carrying, training or for maintenance purposes.

2.3.2

Helicopter ferrying passengers will normally be allocated remote aircraft stands, i.e. stands without aerobridges.

2.4

RADIO FAILURE PROCEDURE

2.4.1

In the event of radio failure, the helicopter affected if on the ground shall not take-off

2.4.2

If radio failure occurs while in the air, alighting and taxiing clearances will be given by the Tower by the use of
the appropriate light signals as described in page ENR 1.1-12, Appendix ‘A’.

2.5

NIGHT OPERATIONS BY HELICOPTERS

2.5.1

Helicopters that are required to operate into and out of Singapore Changi Airport at night shall land on the runway
and ground taxi into its aircraft stand via the lighted taxiways.

ENR 5 NAVIGATION WARNINGS
ENR 5.1 PROHIBITED, RESTRICTED AND DANGER AREAS
1

INTRODUCTION

1.1

All airspace in which a potential hazard to aircraft operations may exist and all areas over which the operation
of civil aircraft may, for one reason or another be restricted either temporarily or permanently, are classified
according to three types of areas as defined by ICAO.

1.2

Each area is described in the tabulation found in pages ENR 5.1-2 to 5.1-5 which indicates its lateral and vertical
limits, the type of restriction or hazard involved, the times at which it applies and other pertinent information.

2

DANGER AREA

2.1

An airspace of defined dimensions within which activities dangerous to the flight of aircraft may exist at specified
times. This term is used only when the potential danger to aircraft has not led to the designation of the airspace
as restricted or prohibited. The effect of the creation of the danger area is to caution operators or pilots of aircraft
that it is necessary for them to assess the dangers in relation to their responsibility for the safety of their aircraft.

3

PROHIBITED AREA

3.1

An airspace of defined dimensions, above the land areas or territorial waters of a State, within which the flight
of aircraft is prohibited. This term is used only when the flight of civil aircraft within the designated airspace is
not permitted at any time under any circumstances.

4

RESTRICTED AREA

4.1

An airspace of defined dimensions, above the land areas or territorial waters of a State, within which the flight
of aircraft is restricted in accordance with certain specified conditions. This term is used whenever the flight of
civil aircraft within the designated airspace is not absolutely prohibited but may be made only if specified
conditions are complied with. Thus, prohibition of flight except at certain meteorological conditions. Similarly,
prohibition of flight unless special permission had been obtained, leads to the designation of restricted area.
However, conditions of flight imposed as a result of application of rules of the air or air traffic service practice
or procedures (for example, compliance with minimum safe heights or with rules stemming from the establishment
of controlled airspace) do not constitute conditions calling for designation as a restricted area.

5

DESIGNATION OF AREA

5.1

Each area is numbered and single series of numbers is used for all areas, regardless of type, to ensure that a
number is never duplicated.

5.2

The type of area involved is indicated by the letter “P” for Prohibited, “R” for Restricted and “D” for Danger,
preceded by the Nationality letters “WS”. For example, areas are assigned numbers and letters in the following
manner - WSP3, WSR6 and WSD4.

1.1 The airspaces designated as Light Aircraft Training Areas are for Local Flying and Training purposes. Flights are to be
conducted during DAYLIGHT hours and in VMC ONLY. The Training Areas are uncontrolled airspaces. It will be the responsibility
of pilots to maintain adequate separation with other aircraft including those operating in the Seletar and Sembawang aerodrome
circuits. All aircraft are to operate strictly within the designated areas and not to stray out of the areas or intrude into adjacent
controlled airspaces.
1.2 Aerobatics and test flights are prohibited in Light Aircraft Training Areas A, B and C.
1.3 The provision of FIS is the responsibility of Paya Lebar Approach. However, due to the nature of training operations carried
out, position and altitude of aircraft will not be made available. The only information that can be provided to pilots will be the
number of REPORTED aircraft within the areas concerned.
1.4 On receipt of the relevant information, it shall be the responsibility of the pilot to decide whether his intended flight can be
carried out safely in view of the prevailing air traffic.
1.5 To enable Paya Lebar Approach to maintain an accurate record of aircraft operating in the areas and to disseminate
up-to-date information, all pilots must report entering and leaving the Training Areas to Paya Lebar Approach.
1.6 Pilots of all aircraft operating within the areas are required to keep a listening watch on the appropriate Paya Lebar Approach
VHF/RT control frequency 127.7 MHz.
1.7 All flights in the Training Areas are to be conducted on Singapore QNH. This value can be obtained from Paya Lebar
Approach.
1.8 In the interest of flight safety, aircraft operating in Light Aircraft Training Area A are advised to make a broadcast on the
controlling frequency specifying their callsign and position when climbing or descending through 2,000ft.

REPORTING OF WILDLIFE STRIKE

2.1

To facilitate efforts to reduce wildlife hazards at and around Singapore airports, pilots and aircraft engineers
are requested to report all wildlife strikes to Air Traffic Control.

2.2

To facilitate the reporting of wildlife strikes, pilots may report them at the earliest opportunity via RTF to Air
Traffic Control.
The RTF phraseology should include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

2.3

Aircraft Callsign
The phrase “WILDLIFE STRIKE REPORT”
Altitude
Approximate geographical location
Time of incident
Effect on flight (e.g. state damage to fuselage, etc.)
Number of wildlife (an estimate)
Size/Type of wildlife (if possible)

To obtain better perspective of the extent of wildlife hazards, the Authority is also collecting data on “near misses”
with wildlife. A “near miss” is defined as a situation in which a wildlife or flock of birds is within close proximity
of an aircraft to cause alarm to the extent whereby pilots would have to take evasive action had such an action
been possible. Pilots should report all “near misses” via RTF to Air Traffic Control.
The RTF phraseology should include the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Each 2° quadrilateral contains an area minimum altitude (AMA) which represents
the lowest altitude which may be used under instrument meteorological
conditions (IMC). The AMA provides a minimum clearance of 1 000 feet (300m)
above all terrains and obstacles in the quadrilateral. It is represented in
thousands and hundreds of feet above mean sea level.

FRICTION MEASURING DEVICE USED AND FRICTION LEVEL BELOW WHICH THE
RUNWAY IS DECLARED SLIPPERY WHEN IT IS WET

5.1

Responsibility

5.1.1

The Changi Airport Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd is responsible for maintaining the civil aerodromes in a satisfactory
condition for flight operations.

5.2

Measurement of Runway Surface Friction

5.2.1

The friction of the runway is calibrated periodically by the use of a Surface Friction Tester using self- wetting
features on a clean surface at a speed of 95 km/hr. The principle employed in this case is the measurement of
the force acting on the measuring wheel along the distance travelled. The equipment provides a continuous
register of the mean coefficient of friction values.

5.2.2

Friction tests will be made over the usable length of the runway, by sections of one third of the length, and at
approximately 3, 6, and 9 metres each side of the centreline in such manner as to produce mean values for each
runway.

5.2.3

Should the friction value fall to 0.34 or less, NOTAM will be promulgated to notify the runway as liable to be
slippery when wet.

5.2.4

The following table would be adopted by Changi Airport Group (Singapore) Civil Maintenance when they report
the friction values tested on the runways.

6.1

Dissemination of Information on Wet Runways
The presence of water on a runway will be reported on RTF using the following descriptions:
DAMP
- the surface shows a change of colour due to moisture
WET
- the surface is soaked but there is no standing water
STANDING WATER - for aeroplane performance purposes, a runway where more than 25 percent of the
runway surface area (whether in isolated areas or not) within the required length and
width being used is covered by water more than 3mm deep.
When a runway is reported as DAMP or WET, subject to any notification to the contrary, pilots may assume that
an acceptable level of runway wheel braking friction is available. When a runway is reported as having STANDING
WATER, wheel braking may be affected by aquaplaning and appropriate operational adjustments should be
considered.

ADB SAFEGATE AIRCRAFT DOCKING GUIDANCE SYSTEM - SAFEDOCK

1.1

INTRODUCTION

← 1.1.1

The ADB Safegate Aircraft Docking Guidance System (ADGS) - SAFEDOCK is a fully automatic aircraft docking
guidance system installed at the contact aircraft stands at Terminals 1, 2, 3 and 4, and at the remote aircraft
stands at South Apron of Singapore Changi Airport.

1.2

DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM

1.2.1

The system is based on a laser scanning technique and it tracks both the lateral and longitudinal position of the
aircraft. This 3D technique allows the system to identify the incoming aircraft and check it against the one selected
by the operator to ensure that the pilot is provided with the correct stop indication for the aircraft.

1.2.2

The system is operated only in the Automatic Mode. When the system fails, the aircraft is to be marshalled into
the stand manually.

1.2.3

Azimuth guidance, continuous closing rate information, aircraft type, etc., are shown to the pilot on a single
display clearly visible for both pilot and co-pilots. Figure A shows the Display and Laser Scanning Unit mounted
on the terminal in front of the aircraft stand.

•

←

Check that the correct aircraft type is
displayed. The scrolling arrows
indicate that the system is activated.
Follow the lead-in line.

When the aircraft is 15m from the stop
position, closing rate information is
given. “Distance to go” is indicated
by turning off one row of LEDs (Laser
Electronic Displays) for every half
metre that the aircraft advances
towards the stop position. From 15m
to the stop position, the display will
indicate the distance from the stop
position for every 1m. At 3m from the
stop position, the display will indicate
the distance from the stop position for
every 0.2m.

STOP Position
•

When the correct stop position is
reached, all of the LEDs for the
closing rate bar will be off, the word
“STOP” in red with red border will

PROCEDURES FOR START-UP AND PUSHBACK OF AIRCRAFT

2.1

Ground crew shall ensure that the area behind an aircraft is clear of vehicles, equipment and other obstructions
before the start-up or pushback of aircraft commences.

2.2

When it becomes necessary to vary a procedure to expedite aircraft movements, Ground Movement Controller
(“Singapore Ground”) shall issue specific instructions to the pilot.

2.3

When the pilot is ready for start-up and pushback, he shall seek confirmation from the ground crew that there
is no hazard to his aircraft starting up. He shall then notify Singapore Ground that he is ready for pushback. On
being told by Singapore Ground that pushback is approved, he shall co-ordinate with the ground crew for the
start-up and pushback of the aircraft.

2.4

The lead-in lines are for aircraft nose-in guidance. For aircraft stands without dedicated pushback lines, ground
crew may use the lead-in lines for pushback guidance.

2.5

For more information, refer to Airport Operations Centre System (AOCS) at https://aoc.changiairport.com/ for
detailed pushback procedures.

ADVANCED MULTILATERATION SYSTEM

3.1

INTRODUCTION

3.1.1

The Multilateration System is a new surveillance system which is able to detect and identify all Mode S equipped
aircraft and vehicles moving on the airport surface even during bad weather conditions such as heavy rain. It
will integrate with the current radar-based ground surveillance system as part of the Advanced-Surface Movement
Guidance and Control System (A-SMGCS) at Singapore Changi Airport. This will enhance the efficiency and
safety at the airport.

3.2

CARRIAGE OF MODE-S SSR TRANSPONDER

3.2.1

Carriage and operation of Mode-S transponder is required for all civil aircraft operating at Singapore Changi
Airport. The Mode-S transponder shall comply, at least, to the requirements of Level 2 as prescribed in ICAO
Annex 10 Volume IV (Amendment 77 or later) Standards and Recommended Practices.

3.3

MULTILATERATION SYSTEM OUTLINE

3.3.1

The Multilateration System uses multiple receivers to pick up “squitters” transmitted by aircraft or vehicle Mode
S transponders. It calculates the position of an aircraft or a vehicle by comparing the time its “squitter” arrives
at each receiver.

3.3.2

The System will derive the identity of an aircraft by selectively interrogating its transponder to receive its assigned
Mode A code or extracting its aircraft identification [that is, the ICAO callsign used in flight and inserted in the
Flight Management System (FMS) or the Transponder Control Panel], if available, from its squitter. For
transponder equipped vehicles, the system will derive their respective identities from the unique Mode S
addresses contained in their squitters.

3.4

AIRCRAFT REQUIREMENTS

3.4.1

The Multilateration System is essentially passive. It relies on aircraft transponders squittering at all times when
moving on the airfield. At present, some aircraft checklist procedures instruct pilots to turn off the transponder
shortly after leaving the runway on arrival and, not to switch it on until reaching the runway holding point for
departure. This is in line with the requirement that Mode A/C transponders should not transmit on the ground,
which does not apply to Mode S transmissions.

3.4.2

For the Multilateration System to work effectively, all aircraft Mode S transponders need to transmit Mode S
squitters at all times when moving on the airfield, starting immediately prior to pushback, and for arrival aircraft
until they are stationary at the aircraft stands. The Mode S transponders should not respond to All-Call
interrogations, but should respond to addressed interrogations.

3.5

PROCEDURES/ACTIONS REQUIRED BY PILOTS

3.5.1

The Multilateration System needs to receive squitters and to acquire the Mode A code of a Mode S equipped
aircraft at all times when it is on the ground. This is to enable detection and identification of the aircraft (from its
Mode A code or ICAO callsign) as soon as it pushes back. Hence, the following actions from pilots are required.

3.5.2

Pre-Pushback / Taxi
a.

Pilots will be required to enter an assigned Mode A code at start-up. This code will be either a discrete or
non-discrete code (a conspicuity code, e.g. 1000).

AIP AMDT 05/2019

AD 2.WSSS-10
10 OCT 2019

3.5.3

AIP Singapore

b.

Pilots shall ensure that the aircraft transponder is operating (that is, XPNDR or the equivalent according
to specific installation, AUTO if available, not OFF or STBY) and the assigned Mode A code is selected
prior to the request for pushback or taxi, whichever is earlier.

c.

Whenever the aircraft is capable of reporting aircraft identification, the aircraft identification must also be
entered prior to the request for pushback or taxi, whichever is earlier, through the FMS or the Transponder
Control Panel. Flight crew must use the 3-letter ICAO designator of the operator, followed by flight
identification number (for example, BAW123, SIA002).

After Landing
a.

Pilots shall ensure that the aircraft transponder is operating (that is, XPNDR or the equivalent according
to specific installation, AUTO if available, not OFF or STBY) after landing, and continuously until the
aircraft is stationary at the aircraft stand.

b.

Pilots shall ensure that the assigned Mode A code is not changed until the aircraft is stationary at the
aircraft stand. (The system requires it for identification of the aircraft).

AIRFIELD GROUND LIGHTING CONTROL AND MONITORING SYSTEM (AGLCMS)
AND MARKINGS

4.1

INTRODUCTION

4.1.1

The taxiing guidance system at Singapore Changi Airport consists of stop bars and green taxiway centreline
lights. The system is designed to provide pilots with visual guidance while taxiing during night operations and
during periods of low visibility. It is controlled by the Ground Movement Controller (GMC) at Changi Control
Tower using the Airfield Ground Lighting Control and Monitoring System (AGLCMS).

4.2

TAXI INSTRUCTIONS

4.2.1

When the green centreline lights are switched on, ATC will issue verbal instructions to pilots/ airline operators
for taxi / tow clearance. The green taxiway centreline lights are provided for guidance. Pilots/ airline operators
shall stop at all red stop bar lights.

4.2.2

All green centreline lights on taxiways leading to the runways terminate at the runway holding positions where,
by default, red stop bar lights remain on unless deselected by the Runway Controller. When deselected, these
stop bar lights will re-activate automatically. Pilots and drivers shall not cross any lighted red stop bar lights.

4.2.3

Pilots and drivers shall enter / cross the runway or taxiway only when both the following conditions are met:
The crew have
a.
b.

Received positive ATC clearance to enter / cross the runway or taxiway, and
Observed that the red stop-bar lights are turned off.

4.3

INFORMATION AND MANDATORY SIGNS/MARKINGS

4.3.1

When following ATC verbal taxi instructions, pilots are advised to also navigate their taxi route with reference
to information and mandatory signs/markings provided at the airport so as to maintain situational awareness of
their whereabouts at all times.

WRONG APPROACHES AND LANDINGS OF AIRCRAFT BOUND FOR SINGAPORE
CHANGI AND PAYA LEBAR AIRPORTS

2.1

INTRODUCTION

2.1.1

The attention of all pilots is drawn to the existence of Paya Lebar Airport close to Singapore Changi Airport. The
runway at Singapore Changi Airport is orientated in the same true bearing as the runway at Paya Lebar Airport
i.e. 023°/203°. Due to the close proximity of these two runways, pilots are cautioned against mistaking Paya
Lebar Airport for the runway of Singapore Changi Airport and thus making an inadvertent visual landing or
approach to land at Paya Lebar.

2.1.2

Erroneous approaches or landings usually occurred during the hours of darkness. In almost every instance, the
weather prevailing at the time of the incident was generally good or fair.

2.1.3

There is intensive local flying at Paya Lebar and Seletar during the day and night. Thus, the risk of collision is
very great if a wrong approach is made to any of the above two airports. Likewise, wrong approaches into
Singapore Changi Airport can also be disastrous.

2.2

POINTS TO BEAR IN MIND WHEN APPROACHING SINGAPORE CHANGI AIRPORT
OR PAYA LEBAR

2.2.1

The following points are highlighted to serve as a guide to assist pilots in making a correct approach into
Singapore Changi Airport or Paya Lebar Airport and should be remembered and followed:
a.

The runways at Singapore Changi Airport and Paya Lebar Airport are identically aligned on 02/ 20.
Therefore exercise extreme vigilance when leaving NYLON or SAMKO Holding Areas inbound and
maintain correct tracks to the respective runways as listed below.

b.

Adhere strictly to IFR procedures even in VMC which calls for a procedure turn over NYLON Holding
Area or SAMKO Holding Area as prescribed.

c.

Make full use of all available navigational and landing aids available and positively identify every aid used.

d.

Switch to the correct ILS localizer frequency at Singapore Changi Airport under all conditions.

LOW VISIBILITY PROCEDURES (LVP) FOR CATEGORY II ILS OPERATIONS

1.1

Introduction

1.1.1

Category II ILS approaches will be made available at Singapore Changi Airport to authorised flights during
prolonged periods of low visibility, except during thunderstorms. RVR minima for CAT II ILS operations is limited
to 350m due to runway and taxiway light spacing requirements on the airfield.

1.2

Authorisation for Category II ILS Approaches

1.2.1

Operators who wish to conduct Category II ILS operations at Singapore Changi Airport must have obtained
operational approval from the relevant State of Operator and be authorised by the Civil Aviation Authority of
Singapore.

1.3

Category II ILS Runways

1.3.1

At Singapore Changi Airport, Category II ILS approaches are available only on RWY 02L and RWY 20C, which
are also equipped with precision approach Category II lighting system. When required, pilots making Category
II ILS approaches to Singapore Changi Airport should refer to the procedures in the Instrument Approach Charts
AD-2-WSSS-IAC-1 to AD-2-WSSS-IAC-11 and the Precision Approach Terrain Charts for RWY 02L and RWY
20C at AD-2-WSSS-PATC-1 and AD-2-WSSS-PATC-2 respectively.

1.4

Initiation of Category II ILS Operations

1.4.1

Preparations will be made to implement LVP for Category II ILS operations at Singapore Changi Airport during
prolonged period of low visibility, except during thunderstorms, when the RVR drops below 800 metres.

1.4.2

Availability of the Category II ILS approaches will be made known through NOTAM and ATIS broadcasts as
well as air traffic control radio communications.

1.4.3

During LVP operations, aircraft will not be cleared for Category II ILS approach if any of the ILS or
approach/runway lights fall below Category II requirements. Aircraft will not be cleared for landing if the Touchdown
Zone RVR is unserviceable.

1.5

ILS Sensitive Areas

1.5.1

Upon landing, pilots shall report to Changi Tower once the aircraft has cleared the runway and has passed the
ILS sensitive areas demarcated by alternate yellow and green lights along the centrelines of Rapid Exit Taxiways
and Cross Taxiways.

1.6

Termination of LVP for Category II ILS Operations

1.6.1

LVP for Category II ILS operations will be terminated when RVR has improved above 800 metres. Termination
of LVP for Category II ILS operations will be made known through NOTAM and ATIS broadcasts as well as air
traffic control radio communications.

1.7

Operations of flights Not Authorised for Category II ILS
Operations

1.7.1

During Category II ILS operations, if the RVR is 550 metres or above, flights not authorised for Category II ILS
operations may continue to make approaches and land. Airlines planning to operate flights not authorised for
Category II ILS operations into Changi shall monitor the METAR to ascertain the RVR values when launching
their flights and be prepared to divert if the RVR is below 550 metres.

2

RUNWAY UTILISATION

2.1

Runway-in-use

2.1.1

The runway-in-use (Departure/Arrival) is selected by Aerodrome Control as the optimum for general purposes
and to maximise runway utilisation. If the assigned runway is unsuitable for a particular operation, the pilot can
obtain permission from ATC to use another runway but should anticipate delay.

2.2

Departures

2.2.1

Pilots should arrange their taxi such that they are ready to depart without delay on reaching the runway holding
point. As standard ICAO wake turbulence separation is being applied, pilots are to advise ATC early if more
time is needed for the aircraft to be ready for departure. When informed, ATC will be able to make changes in
the departure sequence, if necessary, to minimise delays to other succeeding departures.

AIP AMDT 05/2019

© 2019 Civil Aviation Authority Singapore

AIP Singapore

AD 2.WSSS-23
15 AUG 2019

2.2.2

Pilots should complete cockpit checks prior to line-up for departure and keep any checks on the runway to a
minimum.

2.2.3

Conditional line-up clearance may be used by ATC to facilitate an expeditious flow of traffic. On receipt of line-up
clearance, pilots should taxi into position promptly without delay. Unless given instructions to line-up and wait,
pilots should be ready and prepared to depart without stopping. On receipt of take-off clearance, pilots to
commence take-off roll without delay.

2.3

Clearance for Immediate Take-Off

2.3.1

A pilot receiving the ATC instruction ‘cleared for immediate take-off’ is required to act as follows:
a.
b.
c.

if waiting clear of the runway, taxi immediately on to it and begin take-off run immediately without stopping
the aircraft;
if already lined-up on the runway, take-off without delay;
if unable to comply with the instruction, inform ATC immediately.

2.4

Arrivals - Minimum Runway Occupancy Time (ROT)

2.4.1

Arriving aircraft upon landing are reminded that it is imperative to vacate the runway as quickly as practicable
to enable ATC to apply minimum spacing on final approach and minimise the occurrence of “go-arounds”.

2.4.2

To achieve minimum ROT and reduce missed approaches due to occupied runway, pilots should vacate the
runway via the first available exit taxiway corresponding to operational requirements, or as instructed by ATC.
If an exit taxiway other than the first available exit taxiway is required, pilots shall advise the Tower Controller
on first contact.

2.4.3

To enhance planning, pilots can make reference to the Landing Exit Distance (LED), the distance from threshold
to the furthest edge of the exit taxiway:
RWY
Exit Taxiway (LED in metres)
Remarks
20R W6*(1655), W7*(2123) and W8 (3061) Note 1: Recommended exit taxiways are bold and underlined.
20C E6*(1948), E7*(2391) and E8 (3152)
Note 2: * Indicates Rapid Exit Taxiway (RET) and maximum
02L W5*(1966), W4*(2491) and W3* (2876)
design ground speed for the exit taxiway is 50kts.
02C E5*(2055), E4*(2565) and E3* (3267)

2.4.4

Pilots can expect initial taxi instructions from the Runway Controller before clearing the exit taxiway. Aircraft
vacating the runway-in-use should not stop on the exit taxiway until the entire aircraft has passed the runway
holding point.

2.4.5

BTN 0830-1030 daily estimated delays of about 15 minutes can be expected for arrivals into Singapore Changi
Airport.

2.5

Reduced Runway Separation Minima

2.5.1

Reduced Runway Separation Minima may be applied between a departing aircraft and a succeeding landing
aircraft or between two successive landing aircraft on the same runway provided the following conditions exist:
a.

During the hours of daylight from 30 minutes after local sunrise to 30 minutes before local sunset;

b.

Visibility of at least 5km;

c.

Cloud ceiling shall not be lower than 1,000ft;

d.

Tailwind component shall not exceed 5 knots;

e.

The second aircraft will be able to see the first aircraft clearly and continuously until the first aircraft is
clear of the runway;

f.

Traffic information shall be provided to the flight crew of the succeeding aircraft concerned;

g.

The braking action shall not be adversely affected by runway contaminants such as water;

h.

Wake turbulence separation minima shall be applied; and

i.

Responsibility for ensuring adequate separation between the two aircraft rests with the pilot of the second
aircraft.

2.5.2

AIP Singapore

When reduced Runway Separation Minima is applied, the successive landing aircraft may be given a clearance
to land before the first aircraft has cleared the runway-in-use after landing or crossed the runway end on departure
provided there is reasonable assurance that the following separation distances will exist when the landing aircraft
crosses the runway threshold:

RWY
02L/20R

RWY
02C/20C

Landing following Landing
The preceding aircraft has landed and has passed
a point at least 2500m from the threshold of runway
(abeam TWY W4 for RWY 02L or TWY V7 for RWY
20R), is in motion and will vacate the runway without
backtracking.
The preceding aircraft has landed and has passed
a point at least 2500m from the threshold of the
runway (abeam TWY E4 for RWY 02C or TWY E7
for RWY 20C), is in motion and will vacate the
runway without backtracking.

Landing following Departure
The departing aircraft is/will be airborne and has
passed a point at least 2500m from the threshold
of the runway (abeam TWY W4 for RWY 02L or
TWY V7 for RWY 20R).
The departing aircraft is/will be airborne and has
passed a point at least 2500m from the threshold
of the runway (abeam TWY E4 for RWY 02C or
TWY E7 for RWY 20C).

2.6

Phraseology

2.6.1

When issuing a landing clearance following the application of these procedures, ATC will issue the second
aircraft with the following instructions:
".... (call sign) .... after the landing / departing .... (Aircraft Type) Runway .....(Designator) cleared to
land".

3

AIRPORT COLLABORATIVE DECISION MAKING (A-CDM) MODE OF OPERATIONS

3.1

A-CDM aims to optimise airport operations by having an efficient turnaround process and improving the
predictability of operational events. It also helps to improve gate management, flight punctuality, reduce apron
taxiway and holding point congestion which is beneficial to all airport partners. A-CDM involves sharing of
accurate and timely operational information amongst airport partners through different airport systems and
improving work processes by implementing a set of operational procedures.

3.2

The A-CDM procedures apply to all scheduled flights departing Singapore Changi Airport except for VVIP,
CASEVAC, SAR and aircraft on special tasks. ATC shall have full discretion in conduct of such operations.

3.3

Definition of commonly used terms in A-CDM
a.

b.
c.

Target Off Block Time (TOBT) – The time an aircraft operator (AO) or ground handling agent (GHA)
estimates that an aircraft will be ready, all doors closed, boarding bridge removed, pushback vehicle
available and ready to start-up / pushback immediately upon receipt of clearance from ATC.
Target Start Up Approval Time (TSAT) – The time provided by ATC that an aircraft can expect start-up
/ push back approval.
Calculated Take Off Time (CTOT) – A time calculated as a result of tactical slot allocation, at which a
flight is expected to become airborne.

4

A-CDM PRE-DEPARTURE PROCEDURES

4.1

Singapore Changi Airport’s A-CDM portal will automatically calculate a system TOBT for each departure flight
taking into account the estimated or actual in-block time (EIBT / AIBT), minimum turnaround time (MTT) and
scheduled time of departure (STD)

4.2

If the calculated TOBT (EIBT / AIBT + MTT) is earlier than STD, the system will take the STD as TOBT.

4.3

If the calculated TOBT (EIBT / AIBT + MTT) is later than STD, the amount of turnaround delay that system
predicts is equal to TOBT – STD.

4.4

AO are required to assess the system generated TOBT at 40 minutes prior to departure and update it if the
prediction of departure readiness is different. Thereafter, TOBT needs to be monitored and updated constantly
if it is expected to differ by 5 minutes or more until the flight commences pushback. AO can consider delegating
the responsibility of TOBT submission to their ground handling agent (GHA) subject to prior internal arrangements
between AO and GHA.

4.5

TOBT shall be updated through the following systems:
a.
b.

AIP AMDT 05/2019

Airport Operations Centre System (AOCS) A-CDM web based portal; or
Gate Message Input Display (GMID) at boarding rooms;

AIP Singapore

AD 2.WSSS-25
15 AUG 2019

4.6

AO/GHA is encouraged to update TOBT through ONLY one of the above systems in order to avoid any chance
of a miscommunication.

4.7

TOBT information is available through the following channels:
a.
b.
c.
d.

AOCS A-CDM portal;
GMID;
Aircraft Docking Guidance System (ADGS) at contact stands;
Radio communication with GHA or AO.

4.8

The Pre-Departure Sequencer (PDS) will calculate the TSAT automatically by taking into account factors such
as TOBT, calculated take-off time (CTOT), variable taxi times (VTT), wake turbulence category, departure
separation, etc. A pre-departure sequence is determined from the calculated TSATs, thus the accuracy of TOBT
is vital to an optimal TSAT.

4.9

Flights with an invalid or expired TOBT will be instructed by ATC to update TOBT when requesting for clearance.
For non-compliant flights, delays can be expected. AO or GHA are strongly encouraged to update TOBT as
soon as any expected delay to the aircraft readiness for pushback is made available to avoid unnecessary
hold-ups.

4.10

TSAT information is available through the following channels:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.

AOCS A-CDM portal;
GMID;
ADGS at contact stands;
Radio communication with GHA or AO;
ATC - Upon issuance of ATC clearance (for flights parked at aircraft stands without ADGS).

5

A-CDM START-UP PROCEDURES

5.1

Pilot shall ensure aircraft is ready for pushback at TOBT.

5.2

Pilot to maintain communication with the AO / GHA as they are responsible for updating the TOBT. Notify the
AO / GHA to update the TOBT if it is expected to differ by 5 minutes or more.

5.3

Pilot utilising the DCL service on selected routes shall request for ATC clearance through ‘Request for Departure
Clearance Downlink’ (RCD) message no earlier than 20 minutes before TOBT. Refer to WSSS AD 2.22 paragraph
8.4 on the applicable routes for DCL service and procedures.

5.4

Pilot using voice request to contact Ground Movement Planner (Clearance Delivery) and request for ATC
clearance within 5 minutes of TOBT using the following phraseology:
- Callsign
- Destination
- Proposed flight level and alternate level, if any
- Parking position
a.

Pilot shall only request for ATC clearance provided aircraft is ready to pushback at TOBT.

5.5

Regardless of clearance through voice or datalink, all departing aircraft must report to Clearance Delivery when
ready for push within 5 minutes of TOBT.

5.6

ATC will advise the pilot whether the proposed flight level or other alternate flight level is available and an ATC
clearance will be issued accordingly. If pre-departure coordination with an adjacent unit or centre is required,
the pilot will be instructed to standby.

5.7

ATC will update TSAT changes if any, during issuance of ATC clearances. Note that TSAT displayed on ADGS
may not be final and can be revised due to en-route clearance restrictions, ground congestion or flow measures.

5.8

Pilot shall request for pushback from Ground Movement Control within 5 minutes of TSAT after obtaining ATC
clearance, or as directed by ATC.
a.
b.

ATC may swap pushback sequence based on real-time readiness of aircrafts to maximise apron and
runway capacity and reduce the overall delay to traffic as and when required.
At the end of pushback, the departing aircraft must have all engines started and be ready to taxi
immediately, unless otherwise instructed by ATC.

Note: The first aircraft to taxi may not necessarily be the first aircraft to take-off as distances between aircraft
stands and the departure runway vary.

AD 2.WSSS-26
15 AUG 2019

5.9

AIP Singapore

If a flight is unable to pushback by TSAT + 5 minutes due to the aircraft being unready, ATC clearance and
TSAT will be cancelled. Pilot must notify the AO / GHA to update the TOBT for a new TSAT before requesting
for a new ATC clearance. This also applies to aircraft returning back to blocks after pushback.
a.
b.

ATC will inform the aircraft when a clearance is cancelled using the phraseology; “(Callsign of aircraft)
your ATC clearance and TSAT is cancelled (reason). Update TOBT before requesting for new clearance”.
Flight may also have its ATC clearance cancelled if it develops a technical problem after pushback and
is unable to taxi for prolonged duration.

5.10

Non-compliance of initial TSAT may result in an aircraft losing its existing position in the pre- departure sequence.
Delay can be expected as a result of re-sequencing based on new TOBT input.

5.11

If delay in pushback is due to ground traffic movement or ATC clearance restrictions, the ATC clearance and
TSAT will remain valid even if it exceeds TSAT + 5 minutes. TOBT need not be updated for such situations.

5.12

In the event that A-CDM mode of operations need to be cancelled due to any reason, the termination will be
communicated to relevant parties through email by the airport operator and a NOTAM will be issued by ATC.
Pilot shall follow the non-CDM procedures detailed in para 13.

5.13

Clearance request through VHF using the existing voice procedures is still available for applicable flights under
the DCL service.

8.9

ATC will reject the DCL request and send a "revert to voice procedures" message to the pilot if one of the following
occurs:
a.
b.
c.
d.

Flight's routes / destinations not stated in paragraph 8.4
RCD message does not comply with ED-85A or have inaccurate flight data,
e.g. different Callsign / ADES from flight plan
Invalid TOBT
When required by ATC due to flow restriction

8.10

Upon receipt of any “revert to voice procedures” message, pilot shall cancel any clearance received previously
(if any) and follow the existing voice procedures for clearance request, i.e. contact Clearance Delivery within 5
minutes of TOBT.

8.11

Pilot shall monitor the clearance delivery frequency once the DCL process is initiated. In the event of any issues
encountered, ATC will revert to voice procedures.

8.12

ATC will revert with CLD message within 5 minutes of receipt of the RCD message. If no CLD message is
received, pilot is to call on delivery frequency to verify request.

8.13

Pilot shall respond with ‘Departure Clearance Readback Downlink’ (CDA) message within 5 minutes of receipt
of CLD message. Failure to comply may result in a "revert to voice procedures" message being sent.
Note: The DCL process is only complete and clearance confirmed when CDA message is received and processed
successfully.
A “CDA received – clearance confirmed” message will be sent to the pilot.

8.14

Aircraft operator / ground handling agent shall continue to update TOBT to reflect any changes in readiness
time in accordance to A-CDM startup procedures stated in AIP Singapore section WSSS AD 2.22 paragraph

ASSIGNMENT OF FLIGHT LEVELS TO AIRCRAFT DEPARTING FROM SINGAPORE
CHANGI AIRPORT

9.1

Assignment of flight levels to departing aircraft is made on a best-planned-best-served basis (with reference to
TOBT for ATC clearance request detailed in para 5.4). Aircraft will normally be assigned the level requested
unless an alternate level is offered after coordination with the adjacent ATC centres.

9.2

Departing flights from Singapore requesting FL280 or FL320 on L759, M770, N571, N571/N877 or P628 will
be cleared as follows:
a.
b.
c.
d.

Aircraft departing Singapore will be cleared to FL280;
Succeeding aircraft on the same route will be cleared to FL280 with 10min longitudinal separation provided
there is no closing speed with the preceding aircraft;
Additional longitudinal separation as appropriate shall be imposed by ATC when the succeeding aircraft
is faster than the preceding aircraft on the same route;
The first aircraft from either Singapore or Kuala Lumpur to be over GUNIP on N571 or N571/N877, the
Kuala Lumpur/Bangkok FIR boundary on M770 or L759 and VPL on P628 can expect its requested flight
level

10

DELAY IN PUSHBACK AND/OR TAXIING DUE TO OTHER AIRCRAFT

10.1

Delays may be expected for the second aircraft to pushback and to taxi when two or more aircraft are parked
either adjacent to one another or close together. However, it will retain its ATC clearance even if the 5 minutes
grace period allowed for under para 5.9 is exceeded.
Note: The TSAT may not be able to predict delays arising from apron congestion as traffic movement on ground
is dynamic and situations may change on a real time basis depending on aircraft readiness. ATC will facilitate
pushback as soon as possible when traffic permits.

11

DELAY IN TAKE-OFF DUE TO RESTRICTIONS IN THE ATC CLEARANCE

11.1

The ATC clearance may require an aircraft to arrive at a reporting point at a specified time and level or to depart
a number of minutes behind a preceding traffic to establish the appropriate longitudinal separation. Such delay
will not deprive a departing aircraft of its ATC clearance even though the 5 minutes grace period allowed for
under para 5.9 is exceeded.

12

DELAY DUE TO OVERFLIGHTS

12.1

These are flights operating through Singapore FIR without landing at Singapore Changi Airport. Depending on
their positions, a departing aircraft requesting the same level may have to accept an alternate level or may have
to delay its departure in order to establish the prescribed separation.

13

NON-CDM MODE OF OPERATIONS

13.1

The non-CDM procedures is applicable for non-scheduled flights departing Changi Airport or when TOBT and
TSAT references used in A-CDM mode of operations become unavailable due to system issues or maintenance.

13.2

If TOBT cannot be submitted or it is unavailable through different channels stated in para 4.5,
a.
b.

c.

d.

13.3

Pilots shall notify ATC when the aircraft is ready to pushback within 5 minutes.
ATC will advise the pilot whether the proposed flight level or other alternate flight level is available and
an ATC clearance will be issued accordingly. If pre-departure coordination with an adjacent unit or centre
is required, the pilot will be instructed to standby.
Once flight level is accepted by the pilot and an ATC clearance issued, the aircraft must be pushed back
within 5 minutes from the time the ATC clearance is accepted unless other ATC restrictions are imposed.
The ATC clearance will be cancelled on expiry of the 5 minutes grace period. This also applies to situations
when aircraft return to blocks after pushback or develop technical issues and is unable to continue taxi.
Pilots who are ready to depart following the cancellation of an ATC clearance will adopt the procedures
as if it is the first time they are ready to depart.

If TSAT is unavailable through different means stated in para 4.10,
a.

b.

ATC will revert to the gate hold procedures stated in para 14 and issue estimated pushback times
accordingly.

14

GATE HOLD PROCEDURES FOR DEPARTING AIRCRAFT (DURING NON-CDM MODE
OF OPERATIONS)

14.1

Whenever there are about five to seven departing aircraft at the runway holding point, subsequent pushback of
departures will be regulated such that the Ground Movement Planner (GMP) on VHF frequency 121.65MHz
will start to issue pilots with Expected Pushback Time (EPT) as TSAT used in A-CDM operations is not available.
The determination of EPT will take into account an aircraft's parking stand as well as taxi time to the runway-in-use
holding point.

14.2

When an EPT is issued, pilots will be instructed to either remain on GMP frequency or to monitor Singapore
Ground Control (frequencies 121.725MHz, 121.85MHz, 122.55MHz, 124.3MHz or 125.65MHz). It should be
noted that when instructed to monitor the Singapore Ground frequencies, pilots shall not establish contact with
the Singapore Ground Control, rather, pilots shall maintain listening watch on the assigned Singapore Ground
Control frequency and wait for pushback instruction. This is to prevent unnecessary frequency congestion.

14.3

A flight issued with an EPT but chooses to commence pushback before the assigned time will be allowed to do
so subject to traffic. However, the flight should not expect an earlier departure time as the planned pre-departure
sequence will be maintained.

14.4

In a situation when a departing aircraft is occupying a gate that has been assigned to an arriving aircraft, the
departing aircraft will be instructed by GMP to contact Singapore Ground Movement Control for pushback for
the purpose of better gate utilisation.

14.5

To maximise runway utilisation, departure sequence will be planned on the basis of increasing runway throughput
so as to enhance overall efficiency.

15

GROUND MOVEMENT PLANNER ON VHF 121.65MHz

15.1

The frequency shall be used for aircraft pre-flight checks and ATC clearances. Pilot-in-command to make his
initial call from the parked position on this frequency.

16

GROUND MOVEMENT CONTROL ON VHF 121.725MHz, 121.85MHz, 122.55MHz,
124.3MHz and 125.65MHz

16.1

This frequency shall be used for aircraft start-up/push-back clearance.

16.2

Unless otherwise instructed by ATC, the pilot-in-command shall prior to starting engines listen out on the Ground
Movement Control frequency on 121.725MHz, 121.85MHz, 122.55MHz, 124.3MHz or 125.65MHz.

16.3

The pilot-in-command shall:
a.

Request and obtain taxi instructions prior to taxiing;
Note: ATC clearance, including the assigned SSR code will normally be issued prior to push back. Pilot
shall squawk the SSR code immediately when airborne.

b.

Change from Ground Movement Control frequency to the Runway Control frequency when instructed
(118.6MHz or 118.25MHz). It should be noted that when instructed to monitor Singapore Tower frequencies,
pilots shall not establish contact with Singapore Tower; rather, pilots shall maintain a listening watch on
the assigned Singapore Tower frequency and wait for instruction. This is to prevent unnecessary frequency
congestion.

16.4

Departing aircraft will be instructed when to change from 118.6MHz or 118.25MHz to Singapore Departure
frequency 120.3MHz.

16.5

In the case of the aircraft having landed, the pilot-in-command shall change from 118.6MHz or 118.25MHz to
121.725MHz, 121.85MHz, 122.55MHz, 124.3MHz or 125.65MHz immediately upon instructed by ATC after
clearing the runway. He shall maintain watch on 121.725MHz, 121.85MHz, 122.55MHz, 124.3MHz or 125.65MHz
for taxiing and parking instructions until he arrives at his aircraft stand.

17

TAXIING

17.1

Taxi clearance given by Singapore Ground Movement Control will relate to movement on the manoeuvring area,
but excluding the marshalling area.

17.2

Aircraft taxiing on the manoeuvring area will be regulated by ATC to avoid or reduce possible conflict and will
be provided with traffic information and alerting service. ATC shall apply taxiing clearance limits whenever
necessary.

© 2019 Civil Aviation Authority Singapore

AIP AMDT 05/2019

AD 2.WSSS-32
15 AUG 2019

AIP Singapore

17.3

The taxiway routes to be used by aircraft after landing or when taxiing for departure will be specified by ATC.
The issuance by ATC of a taxi route to an aircraft does not relieve the pilot-in-command of the responsibility to
maintain separation with other aircraft on the manoeuvring area or to comply with ATC directions intended to
regulate aircraft on the manoeuvring area. Pilots are also advised of the possibility of misjudging the
clearance between the aircraft wing tips and other obstacles, especially in areas of hot-spots or
during low-light / poor visibility conditions.

17.4

Pilots are reminded to always use minimum power when starting engines, when manoeuvring within the apron
area or when manoeuvring from apron taxiways to other parts of the aerodrome. It is especially critical when
commencing to taxi that break-away thrusts are kept to an absolute minimum and then be reduced to idle thrusts
as soon as possible.

18

TAKE-OFF AND LANDING

18.1

Departing aircraft will normally be directed by ATC to use the full length of the runway for take-off. On obtaining
an ATC clearance the aircraft shall enter the runway via designated taxiways:
RWY 02C - TWY E10 or E11
RWY 02L - TWY W8, W9 or W10
RWY 20C - TWY E1, E2
RWY 20R - TWY W1, W2

18.2

The pilot-in-command shall not take-off or land without a clearance from Aerodrome Control.

18.3

The pilot-in-command shall not run-up on the runway in use unless authorised by Aerodrome Control. Engine
run-ups in the holding pan or taxiway holding point clear of the runway in use may be carried out subject to
approval by Aerodrome Control.

18.4

After landing, the pilot-in-command shall vacate the runway by the shortest suitable route and to contact Singapore
Ground Movement Control who will issue specific taxi route instructions to its assigned aircraft stand.

18.5

Aircraft with radio communication failure shall vacate the runway and stop on the taxiway and watch for light
signals from Aerodrome Control.

19

SID / STAR PHRASEOLOGIES

21.1

SID / STAR phraseologies allow ATC and pilot to communicate and understand detailed clearance information
that would otherwise require long and potentially complex transmissions. To eliminate safety risk due to a
mismatch between ATC and pilot expectations when SID / STAR phraseologies are used, and what certain
terms may mean, ICAO has published Amendment 7-A to Doc 4444, PANS- ATM to harmonise the core
phraseologies that positively reinforce the lateral, vertical and speed requirements embedded in a SID or STAR
that will continue to apply, unless explicitly cancelled or amended by the controller.

21.2

The core phraseologies are:
i.
ii.

21.3

These require the aircraft to:
i.
ii.
iii.

21.4

CLIMB VIA SID TO (level), CANCEL SPEED RESTRICTION(S)
DESCEND VIA STAR TO (level), CANCEL LEVEL RESTRICTION(S) AT (point(s))

These phraseologies mean that:
i.
ii.

21.6

Climb / descend to the cleared level in accordance with published level restrictions;
Follow the lateral profile of the procedure; and
Comply with published speed restrictions or ATC-issued speed control instructions as applicable.

Phraseologies for removal of speed or level restrictions are:
i.
ii.

21.5

CLIMB VIA SID TO (level)
DESCEND VIA STAR TO (level)

The lateral profile of the procedure continue to apply and
Speed or level restrictions which have not been referred to will continue to apply.

Phraseologies for variations to the lateral profile of the SID / STAR are:
i.
ii.

PROCEED DIRECT (waypoint), or
VECTORING

© 2019 Civil Aviation Authority Singapore

AIP AMDT 05/2019

AD 2.WSSS-36
15 AUG 2019

AIP Singapore

21.7

These phraseologies mean that speed and level restrictions associated with the bypassed waypoints are
cancelled.

21.8

Phraseology to clear aircraft to return to SID / STAR is: REJOIN SID / STAR

21.9

This phraseology means that speed and level restrictions associated with the waypoint where the rejoin occurs,
as well as those associated with all subsequent waypoints must be complied with.

21.10

The term ‘VIA’ will no longer be used when issuing lateral routing clearances.

22

ARRIVING AIRCRAFT

22.1

The pilot-in-command of an arriving aircraft shall contact the appropriate Approach Control Unit 10 minutes
before entering the CTR or ATZ.

23

LIGHT AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS

23.1

Light aircraft operations into and out of Singapore Changi Airport may be approved subject to the following
conditions:
a.
b.
c.
d.

Prior permission has been granted;
Aircraft is suitably equipped;
Pilot is appropriately rated;
Subject to ATC.

23.2

Flight notification shall be given by filing a flight plan.

23.3

All such operations will be regulated in accordance with IFR procedures.

24

SIMULTANEOUS INDEPENDENT PARALLEL APPROACHES

24.1

Introduction

24.1.1

Simultaneous independent parallel approaches will be implemented daily between 0000UTC and 1500UTC to
optimize runway utilization and enhance air traffic efficiency.

24.2

Procedures for simultaneous independent parallel approaches

24.2.1

To ensure safe operations between aircraft on parallel approaches, Normal Operating Zones (NOZs) are
established for each extended runway centreline and a No Transgression Zone (NTZ) is established between
the NOZs.

24.2.2

ATC will vector arriving flights into Singapore Changi Airport from the final waypoint of the respective STARs
to the respective NOZs.

24.2.3

Within the NOZ, ATC shall provide a minimum vertical separation of 1,000ft or 3NM surveillance separation
between pairs of aircraft until both aircraft are established on the ILS Localizer course.

24.2.4

ATC is not required to provide separation between aircraft on adjacent ILS Localizers and will monitor aircraft
for deviation from the approach path.

24.2.5

Aircraft can expect to maintain altitude 3,500ft till Glide Path Interception for Runway 20R / 02L and 2,500ft till
Glide Path Interception for Runway 20C / 02C. This is to ensure the necessary vertical separation prior to
establishing on the respective ILS Localizer course.

24.2.6

Aircraft can expect the following radiotelephony phraseology when intercepting the ILS:
a.

to intercept the Localizer before clearing for ILS
“TURN LEFT (RIGHT) HEADING (three digits) MAINTAIN (altitude) REPORT ESTABLISHED ON
THE LOCALIZER RUNWAY (number) LEFT (CENTRE / RIGHT)”
followed by ...
"MAINTAIN (altitude), CLEARED FOR ILS APPROACH RUNWAY (number) LEFT
(CENTRE/RIGHT)"
or

b.

to intercept ILS
“TURN LEFT (RIGHT) HEADING (three digits) MAINTAIN (altitude) CLEARED FOR ILS
APPROACH RUNWAY (number) LEFT (CENTRE / RIGHT)”

24.2.7

Aircraft can expect to maintain speed 180kt at base turn or earlier till 8NM from touchdown.

24.3

Break-out manoeuvre

24.3.1

When an aircraft is observed to have not established on the appropriate Localizer course or deviated from its
course towards the NTZ, ATC will instruct the aircraft to return immediately to the correct Localizer course with
the following radiotelephony phraseology:
“YOU HAVE CROSSED THE LOCALIZER, TURN LEFT (or RIGHT) IMMEDIATELY AND RETURN TO
THE LOCALIZER”
or
“TURN LEFT (or RIGHT) TO RETURN TO LOCALIZER COURSE”

24.3.2

When ATC observed aircraft to be penetrating or will penetrate the NTZ, ATC will instruct the aircraft on the
adjacent Localizer course to alter course to avoid the deviating aircraft with the following radiotelephony
phraseology:
“TRAFFIC ALERT, TURN LEFT (or RIGHT) IMMEDIATELY HEADING (degrees), CLIMB AND MAINTAIN
(altitude)”

24.4

Pilot notification and conditions for operations

24.4.1

Simultaneous approaches to parallel runways operation will be broadcasted on ATIS during the active period.

24.4.2

Simultaneous approaches to the parallel runways will be suspended in the event of adverse weather or any
other conditions that may affect the safe conduct of such approaches to the parallel runways.

WSSS AD 2.23 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

BIRD CONCENTRATION IN THE VICINITY OF THE AIRPORT

1.1

A number of varieties of birds are found in Singapore throughout the year. The larger birds commonly found in
Singapore Changi Airport include the following:
- cattle egrets
(weighing approximately 400g each)
- intermediate egrets
(weighing approximately 500g each)
- brahminy kites
(weighing approximately 600g each)
- grey herons
(weighing approximately 1500g each)
- white-bellied sea eagle (weighing approximately 2900g each)

← 1.2
1.3

There could be an increase in bird activities during the migratory months of September to March. During this
period, migratory birds may use the airport as their feeding ground.
Various active dispersal devices generating light, sound or cracking effects are used for bird dispersal to mitigate
wildlife hazards where necessary within Singapore Changi Airport (such as handheld laser device, long range
acoustic device, scarecrow, stock-whip, pyrotechnic, etc.).

1. An IFR flight operating into Singapore Changi Airport may be cleared for a visual approach subject to the following
conditions :a)
The pilot has the aerodrome in sight and can conduct his approach with visual reference to terrain;
b)
The flight will not cause delay to other traffic;
c)
There is no conflicting tall vessel movement;
d)
The cloud ceiling at the aerodrome is 4,000ft or more for landing on RWY 20C/R and 3,000ft or more for
on RWY 02C/L ; and
e)
The visibility at the aerodrome is 5km or more.
2. Notwithstanding para 1d) and 1e), if the pilot reports that he has the aerodrome in sight and can conduct his
approach with visual reference to terrain, the flight may be cleared for a visual approach.
3. Pilots may expect radar vectoring for separation and sequencing with other traffic prior to being cleared for a visual
approach.

WRONG APPROACHES AND LANDINGS OF AIRCRAFT BOUND FOR SELETAR
AERODROME AND SEMBAWANG MILITARY AERODROME

3.1

INTRODUCTION

3.1.1

The attention of all pilots is drawn to the existence of RSAF Sembawang Aerodrome, 3NM to the west of Seletar
Aerodrome. The runway at Sembawang is orientated in almost the same direction as the runway at Seletar
Aerodrome i.e. 03/21 for Seletar Aerodrome and 05/23 for Sembawang. Due to the close proximity of these two
runways, pilots are cautioned against mistaking Sembawang Aerodrome for Seletar Aerodrome and thus making
an inadvertent visual landing or approach to land at Sembawang.

3.1.2

Erroneous approaches or landings usually occurred in marginal weather conditions. In almost every instance,
the prevailing weather at the time of the incident contributed towards a hasty and erroneous identification of the
correct aerodrome.

3.1.3

There is intensive local flying at both aerodromes during the day and night. As pilot training is the major activity
at both aerodromes, the risk of collision is very great if a wrong approach or landing is made at either of the two
aerodromes.

3.2

POINTS TO BEAR IN MIND WHEN APPROACHING SELETAR AD OR SEMBAWANG
AD

3.2.1

The following points are highlighted to serve as a guide to assist pilots in identifying Seletar AD or Sembawang
AD and should be remembered and followed:
a.
b.
c.

The runways at Seletar and Sembawang are almost identically aligned. Extra vigilance, therefore, is
required when approaching either aerodrome, or when commencing an approach to land.
Make full use of available navigational and landing aids, and positively identify each aid used.
Adhere strictly to the joining instructions issued by ATC.

ADVISORY DEPARTURE PROCEDURES FOR RUNWAY 03
On departure, pilots of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft should climb ahead to an altitude
cleared by ATC. Pilots can expect a radar heading to leave Seletar CTR. Where a radar heading is not
given, pilots shall navigate to SETHI-RECHI-PONJO-SJ, or navigate to KK in accordance with their ATC
clearance.
CAUTION
a) Pilots are required to keep clear of Sembawang ATZ. Turns should therefore be kept within
Seletar CTR.
b) Pilots should not fly to the east of the runway. This is to keep clear of tall buildings up to 296ft
AMSL there. Pilots should have all relevant obstructions in sight, including the steel structure
300ft AMSL and the Silo 342ft AMSL 2nm north of the airfield.
c) When cleared via SETHI-RECHI-PONJO-SJ, pilots shall not deviate from the clearance unless
approved by ATC. This is due to the proximity of WSR38 which is Permanently active from
Ground to 10,000ft.
d) Pilots shall maintain a speed of not more than 185KTS until passing PONJO to mitigate risk of
encroaching into WSD4.
e)

Minimum altitudes apply over noise abatement areas (WSSL AD 2.21)
Aircraft types which are unable to safely manoeuvre clear of the noise abatement areas are
not allowed to operate at Seletar Airport.

ADVISORY DEPARTURE PROCEDURES FOR RUNWAY 21
On departure, pilots can expect climb to an initial altitude cleared by ATC. Pilots of fixed-wing
aircraft navigating to KK can expect to turn right to join the circuit till end of downwind and then
expect a radar heading to leave Seletar CTR. Where a radar heading is not given, pilots shall navigate
to RECHI-PONJO-SJ, or navigate to KK in accordance with their ATC clearance.
Pilots of rotary-wing aircraft can expect to turn left after departure to join the helicopter circuit
pattern till end of downwind. Thereafter, they can expect further en-route clearance.
CAUTION
a) Pilots are required to keep clear of Sembawang ATZ. Turns should therefore be kept within
Seletar CTR.
b) Pilots should not fly to the east of the runway. This is to keep clear of tall buildings up to 296ft
AMSL there. Pilots should have all relevant obstructions in sight, including the steel structure
300ft AMSL and the Silo 342ft AMSL 2nm north of the airfield.

Taxiing Procedures
Taxiing in/out of Apron Areas
Pilots taxiing in/out of apron areas must adhere to ATC’s instructions. Once a pilot has reported visual with the
marshallers, the pilot will be instructed to continue to taxi and follow the marshaller’s instructions. At any time, should
the aircraft pilot decide not to comply with the marshaller’s instructions, it is mandatory for the pilot or the marshalling
agency to inform ATC immediately. All marshalling services shall terminate at that moment and the pilot will be instructed
by ATC to shutdown the aircraft. Concurrently, ATC will also inform the marshallers via the ground communications
network. Subsequently, the aircraft will be towed to its allocated aircraft stand. Pilots are to exercise caution when
operating in the apron areas due to close proximity of obstacles (e.g. Floodlights, buildings, etc.)
To minimize the possibility of ground taxiing confliction within the apron areas as well as to achieve an orderly flow of
aircraft ground movements, the following guidelines are recommended for both RWY 02 (Departures) and RWY 20
(Arrivals):
Apron
Departures
Arrivals
Apron A
Taxi for RWY 02 departure via TWY F4.
TWY F3 or F4
Apron B
No taxiing is allowed within Apron B and TWY W7. Aircraft will be towed in/out of Apron B to an
assigned aircraft stand via TWY W7.
Apron C
TWY F1
TWY F1 or F2
Jet Apron/Jet
TWY F3
TWY F3
Apron
Extension
Ground Taxiing Guidelines
The recommended taxiing guidelines may be subject to changes due to work-in-progress or unforeseen circumstances
and shall be included in the NOTAM. Pilots will receive a taxiing brief from the Flight Planning office prior to departure.
Ground Restrictions due to Weather
In the event of inclement weather over Paya Lebar airport, ground support services for aircraft are to be terminated
when the meteorological office issues a Lightning Risk Category 1 warning (very high lightning risk with extremely
probable lightning producing CB clouds over the affected area). Ground agencies will be alerted of the warnings
through the Base Public Announcement system as well as through the ground communications network. The following
ground support services are to be terminated:
a) aircraft refuelling and de-refuelling
b) towing of aircraft in the open
c) maintenance works on aircraft on the apron areas
d) marshalling of aircraft in and out of the apron areas
e) loading and unloading of cargo from aircraft
f) customs and immigration checks in the apron areas
There is no work restriction for Lightning Risk Categories 2, 3, 4 and 5. As aircraft marshalling is not permitted during
Lightning Risk Category 1, aircraft that has landed at Paya Lebar Airport will be instructed to hold at the following
designated areas until the warning has expired:
a) Non-VIP aircraft at TWY F1, F2, F3 or F4
b) VIP aircraft at TWY F3 or F4

SURFACE MOVEMENT GUIDANCE AND CONTROL SYSTEM AND MARKINGS
There may be occasions when despite a declaration of Lightning Risk Category 1, certain activities would still need
to be performed in the open areas due to critical or operational requirements. In such instances, approval must be
sought from Paya Lebar Tower after careful assessment of the overall weather situation over Paya Lebar Airport.
Examples of such critical activities include:
a) Marshalling of VVIP / VIP aircraft
b) Embarkation / disembarkation of VIP from aircraft
Ground Procedures - General
Engine Start-ups and Ground Runs
Clearance from the Ground Controller must be sought and obtained for all engine start-ups or any associated activities
within the apron areas. In addition, all engine ground runs, regardless of intensity, must be co-ordinated with ATC for
approval. However, ground runs exceeding 85% of the engine power are prohibited within the apron areas. Within
Paya Lebar Airport, the designated area for engine ground runs exceeding 85% of the engine power are the Northern
Access Run-up Pad and Hush-House or as designated by Paya Lebar Base Command Post. The area allocated will
be dependent on the type of aircraft concerned.
Aircraft to/from Apron B
Engine start-ups and shutdowns at TWY W7 are strictly prohibited. Aircraft departing or arriving to/from Apron B shall
be allocated the appropriate aircraft stands for their start-ups or shutdowns and shall be towed in/out of the allocated
aircraft stand. In addition, wing-walkers are to be provided for large aircraft on tow at TWY W7 due to construction
works located next to TWY W7.
Prohibited Activities - Smoking in the Apron Areas
Smoking is strictly prohibited within the Apron areas. Disciplinary action will be taken on any personnel caught
contravening this restriction.

INTRODUCTION

1.1

RSAF Tengah Air Base is nominated as the emergency diversionary aerodrome for Singapore Changi Airport.
The arrangement outlined below is applicable for the handling of any civil aircraft movement that is diverted to
RSAF Tengah Air Base.

1.2

It is emphasised that RSAF Tengah Air Base is not an ICAO designated alternate aerodrome for Singapore
Changi Airport and therefore should not be flight planned as such. Its use by civil aircraft is permitted for
emergency purposes only when Singapore Changi Airport runway is obstructed.

Base by the RSAF Security Guard. Entry into the Air Base by both the airline personnel and service equipment
is via the main gate. The Airline Engineering Coordinator shall be responsible for the proper positioning of the
ground servicing equipment and vehicles in the Apron Area where arriving aircraft are to be parked.

5.2

No equipment, vehicles, stores, cargo or mail shall be left overnight at Tengah Air Base.

5.3

The security of civil aircraft parked in the Apron is the responsibility of the aircraft owner and any security service
obtained shall first be cleared with the Tengah Air Base Security Authorities.
